<H3 align=left>Portfolio Turnover</H3>
<P align=left>The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys
and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher portfolio
turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher
taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not
reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example, affect the fund's
performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio turnover
rate was 2% of the average value of its portfolio. </P>

<P align=left><B><I>Principal Investment Strategies</I></B> </P>

<P align=left>Geode normally invests at least 80% of the fund's assets in common
stocks included in the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index. The Dow Jones
U.S. Total Stock Market Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization-weighted
index of approximately 5,000 common stocks of companies headquartered in the
United States, on a primary U.S. exchange. The Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market
Index represents the performance of a broad range of U.S. stocks. </P>
<P align=left>The fund may not always hold all of the same securities as the Dow
Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index. Geode may use statistical sampling
techniques to attempt to replicate the returns of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock
Market Index using a smaller number of securities. Statistical sampling
techniques attempt to match the investment characteristics of the index and the
fund by taking into account such factors as capitalization, industry exposures,
dividend yield, P/E ratio, P/B ratio, and earnings growth. </P>
<P align=left>The fund may not track the index because differences between the
index and the fund's portfolio can cause differences in performance. In
addition, expenses and transaction costs, the size and frequency of cash flows
into and out of the fund, and differences between how and when the fund and the
index are valued can cause differences in performance. </P>

<P align=left>The fund may lend securities to broker-dealers or other
institutions to earn income. </P>
<P align=left>In addition to the principal investment strategies discussed
above, Geode may also use various techniques, such as buying and selling futures
contracts, swaps, and exchange traded funds, to increase or decrease the fund's
exposure to changing security prices or other factors that affect security
values. </P>
<P align=left>If Geode's strategies do not work as intended, the fund may not
achieve its objective. </P>

<P align=left><I>Equity securities</I> represent an ownership interest, or the

<P align=left>Many factors affect each fund's performance. A fund's share price
changes daily based on changes in market conditions and interest rates and in
response to other economic, political, or financial developments. A fund's
reaction to these developments will be affected by the types of securities in
which the fund invests, the financial condition, industry and economic sector,
and geographic location of an issuer, and the fund's level of investment in the
securities of that issuer. When you sell your shares they may be worth more or
less than what you paid for them, which means that you could lose money by
investing in a fund. </P>
<P align=left>The following factors can significantly affect a fund's
performance: </P>
<P align=left><I>Stock Market Volatility.</I> The value of equity securities
fluctuates in response to issuer, political, market, and economic developments.
Fluctuations, especially in foreign markets, can be dramatic over the short as
well as long term, and different parts of the market, including different market
sectors, and different types of equity securities can react differently to these
developments. For example, stocks of companies in one sector can react
differently from those in another, large cap stocks can react differently from
small cap stocks, and "growth" stocks can react differently from "value" stocks.
Issuer, political, or economic developments can affect a single issuer, issuers
within an industry or economic sector or geographic region, or the market as a
whole. Changes in the financial condition of a single issuer can impact the
market as a whole. Terrorism and related geo-political risks have led, and may
in the future lead, to increased short-term market volatility and may have
adverse long-term effects on world economies and markets generally. </P>
<P align=left><I>Foreign Exposure.</I> Foreign securities, foreign currencies,
and securities issued by U.S. entities with substantial foreign operations can
involve additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory
conditions in foreign countries. These risks include fluctuations in foreign
exchange rates; withholding or other taxes; trading, settlement, custodial, and
other operational risks; and the less stringent investor protection and
disclosure standards of some foreign markets. All of these factors can make
foreign investments, especially those in emerging markets, more volatile and
potentially less liquid than U.S. investments. In addition, foreign markets can
perform differently from the U.S. market. </P>
<P align=left>Global economies and financial markets are becoming increasingly
interconnected, which increases the possibilities that conditions in one country
or region might adversely impact issuers or providers in, or foreign exchange
rates with, a different country or region. </P>
<P align=left><I>Issuer-Specific Changes.</I> Changes in the financial condition
of an issuer or counterparty, changes in specific economic or political
conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer, and changes in
general economic or political conditions can increase the risk of default by an
issuer or counterparty, which can affect a security's or instrument's value.
</P>
<P align=left><I>Correlation to Index.</I> The performance of the fund and its
index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and expenses of the fund,
imperfect correlation between the fund's securities and those in its index,
timing differences associated with additions to and deletions from its index,
and changes in the shares outstanding of the component securities. The fund may
not be fully invested at times, either as a result of cash flows into the fund
or as a result of reserves of cash held by the fund to meet redemptions. The use
of sampling techniques or futures or other derivative positions may affect the
fund's ability to achieve close correlation with its index. </P>
<P align=left><I>Mid Cap Investing.</I> The value of securities of medium size,
less well-known issuers can be more volatile than that of relatively larger
issuers and can react differently to issuer, political, market, and economic
developments than the market as a whole and other types of stocks. </P>
<P align=left><I>Small Cap Investing.</I> The value of securities of smaller,
less well-known issuers can be more volatile than that of larger issuers and can
react differently to issuer, political, market, and economic developments than
the market as a whole and other types of stocks. Smaller issuers can have more
limited product lines, markets, and financial resources. </P>
<P align=left>In response to market, economic, political, or other conditions, a
fund may temporarily use a different investment strategy for defensive purposes.
If the fund does so, different factors could affect its performance and the fund
may not achieve its investment objective. </P>

<H3 align=left>Fundamental Investment Policies</H3>
<P align=left>The following is fundamental, that is, subject to change only by
shareholder approval: </P>
<P align=left><B class="fund-name"></B> seeks to provide investment
results that correspond to the total return of a broad range of United States
stocks. </P>
<H3 align=left>Shareholder Notice</H3>
<P align=left>The following is subject to change only upon 60 days' prior notice
to shareholders: </P>
<P align=left><B class="fund-name"></B> normally invests at least
80% of its assets in common stocks included in the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock
Market Index. </P>
<H2 id=0.2.1P3J9P1.L4AU55.L62JNN.A align=left><A name=ref109261></A><A
name=sib156362>Valuing Shares</A></H2>
<P align=left>Each fund is open for business each day the NYSE is open. </P>
<P align=left>NAV is the value of a single share. Financial normally calculates
NAV as of the close of business of the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time.
Each fund's assets normally are valued as of this time for the purpose of
computing NAV. Financial calculates NAV separately for each class of shares of a
multiple class fund. </P>
<P align=left>NAV is not calculated and a fund will not process purchase and
redemption requests submitted on days when the fund is not open for business.
The time at which shares are priced and until which purchase and redemption
orders are accepted may be changed as permitted by the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC). </P>
<P align=left>To the extent that a fund's assets are traded in other markets on
days when the fund is not open for business, the value of the fund's assets may
be affected on those days. In addition, trading in some of a fund's assets may
not occur on days when the fund is open for business. </P>
<P align=left>NAV is calculated using the values of other open-end funds, if
any, in which a fund invests (referred to as underlying funds). Shares of
underlying funds are valued at their respective NAVs. Other assets (as well as
assets held by an underlying Financial non-money market fund) are valued
primarily on the basis of market quotations, official closing prices, or
information furnished by a pricing service. Certain short-term securities are
valued on the basis of amortized cost. If market quotations, official closing
prices, or information furnished by a pricing service are not readily available
or, in the Adviser's opinion, are deemed unreliable for a security, then that
security will be fair valued in good faith by the Adviser in accordance with
applicable fair value pricing policies. For example, if, in the Adviser's
opinion, a security's value has been materially affected by events occurring
before a fund's pricing time but after the close of the exchange or market on
which the security is principally traded, then that security will be fair valued
in good faith by the Adviser in accordance with applicable fair value pricing
policies. Fair value pricing will be used for high yield debt securities when
available pricing information is determined to be stale or for other reasons not
to accurately reflect fair value. Assets held by an underlying Financial money
market fund are valued on the basis of amortized cost. </P>
<P align=left>Arbitrage opportunities may exist when trading in a portfolio
security or securities is halted and does not resume before a fund calculates
its NAV. These arbitrage opportunities may enable short-term traders to dilute
the NAV of long-term investors. Securities trading in overseas markets present
time zone arbitrage opportunities when events affecting portfolio security
values occur after the close of the overseas markets but prior to the close of
the U.S. market. Fair valuation of a fund's portfolio securities can serve to
reduce arbitrage opportunities available to short-term traders, but there is no
assurance that fair value pricing policies will prevent dilution of NAV by
short-term traders. </P>
<P align=left>Policies regarding excessive trading may not be effective to
prevent short-term NAV arbitrage trading, particularly in regard to omnibus
accounts. </P>
<P align=left>Fair value pricing is based on subjective judgments and it is
possible that the fair value of a security may differ materially from the value
that would be realized if the security were sold. </P>

<H1 align=left>Shareholder Information</H1>
<H2 id=0.2.1P3J9P1.L4AU55.L62JNN.C align=left><A name=ref109161></A><A
name=sib156363>Additional Information about the Purchase and Sale of
Shares</A></H2>
<P align=left>As used in this prospectus, the term "shares" generally refers to
the shares offered through this prospectus. </P>
<H3 align=left>General Information</H3>
<P align=left>Financial Investments was established in 1946 to manage one of
America's first mutual funds. Today, Financial is one of the world's largest
providers of financial services. </P>
<P align=left>In addition to its mutual fund business, the company operates one
of America's leading brokerage firms, Financial Brokerage Services LLC. Financial
is also a leader in providing tax-advantaged retirement plans for individuals
investing on their own or through their employer. </P>
<P align=left>Subject to the purchase and sale requirements stated in this
prospectus, you may buy or sell shares through a Financial brokerage account or a
Financial mutual fund account. If you buy or sell shares (other than by exchange)
through a Financial brokerage account, your transactions generally involve your
Financial brokerage core (a settlement vehicle included as part of your Financial
brokerage account). </P>
<P align=left>If you do not currently have a Financial brokerage account or a
Financial mutual fund account and would like to invest in a fund, you may need to
complete an application. For more information about a Financial brokerage account
or a Financial mutual fund account, please visit Financial's web site at
www.Financial.com, call 1-800-Financial, or visit a Financial Investor Center (call
1-800-544-9797 for the center nearest you). </P>
<P align=left>You may also buy or sell shares through a retirement account (such
as an IRA or an account funded through salary deduction) or an investment
professional. Retirement specialists are available at 1-800-544-4774 to answer
your questions about Financial retirement products. If you buy or sell shares
through a retirement account or an investment professional, the procedures for
buying, selling, and exchanging shares and the account features, policies, and
fees may differ from those discussed in this prospectus. Fees in addition to
those discussed in this prospectus may apply. For example, you may be charged a
transaction fee if you buy or sell shares through a non-Financial broker or other
investment professional. </P>
<P align=left><B>You should include the following information with any
order:</B> </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Your name
  <LI>Your account number
  <LI>Type of transaction requested
  <LI>Name(s) of fund(s) and class(es)
  <LI>Dollar amount or number of shares </LI></UL>
<P align=left>Certain methods of contacting Financial may be unavailable or
delayed (for example, during periods of unusual market activity). In addition,
the level and type of service available may be restricted. </P>
<H3 align=left>Frequent Purchases and Redemptions</H3>
<P align=left>A fund may reject for any reason, or cancel as permitted or
required by law, any purchase or exchange, including transactions deemed to
represent excessive trading, at any time. </P>
<P align=left>Excessive trading of fund shares can harm shareholders in various
ways, including reducing the returns to long-term shareholders by increasing
costs to a fund (such as brokerage commissions or spreads paid to dealers who
sell money market instruments), disrupting portfolio management strategies, and
diluting the value of the shares in cases in which fluctuations in markets are
not fully priced into the fund's NAV. </P>
<P align=left>Each fund reserves the right at any time to restrict purchases or
exchanges or impose conditions that are more restrictive on excessive trading
than those stated in this prospectus. </P>
<H3 align=left>Excessive Trading Policy</H3>
<P align=left>The Board of Trustees has adopted policies designed to discourage
excessive trading of fund shares. Excessive trading activity in a fund is
measured by the number of roundtrip transactions in a shareholder's account and
each class of a multiple class fund is treated separately. A roundtrip
transaction occurs when a shareholder sells fund shares (including exchanges)
within 30 days of the purchase date. </P>
<P align=left>Shareholders with two or more roundtrip transactions in a single
fund within a rolling 90-day period will be blocked from making additional
purchases or exchange purchases of the fund for 85 days. Shareholders with four
or more roundtrip transactions across all Financial funds within any rolling
12-month period will be blocked for at least 85 days from additional purchases
or exchange purchases across all Financial funds. Any roundtrip within 12 months
of the expiration of a multi-fund block will initiate another multi-fund block.
Repeat offenders may be subject to long-term or permanent blocks on purchase or
exchange purchase transactions in any account under the shareholder's control at
any time. In addition to enforcing these roundtrip limitations, the fund may in
its discretion restrict, reject, or cancel any purchases or exchanges that, in
the Adviser's opinion, may be disruptive to the management of the fund or
otherwise not be in the fund's interests. </P>
<H3 id=Main7b.html.17 align=left>Exceptions</H3>
<P align=left>The following transactions are exempt from the fund's excessive
trading policy described above: (i) transactions of $1,000 or less, (ii)
systematic withdrawal and/or contribution programs, (iii)&nbsp;mandatory
retirement distributions, and (iv) transactions initiated by a plan sponsor or
sponsors of certain employee benefit plans or other related accounts. In
addition, the fund's excessive trading policy does not apply to transactions
initiated by the trustee or adviser to a donor-advised charitable gift fund,
qualified fund of fund(s), or other strategy funds. A qualified fund of fund(s)
is a mutual fund, qualified tuition program, or other strategy fund consisting
of qualified plan assets that either applies the fund's excessive trading
policies to shareholders at the fund of fund(s) level, or demonstrates that the
fund of fund(s) has an investment strategy coupled with policies designed to
control frequent trading that are reasonably likely to be effective as
determined by the fund's Treasurer. </P>
<P align=right><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><B>Shareholder Information - continued</B> </P>
<H3 align=left>Omnibus Accounts</H3>
<P align=left>Omnibus accounts, in which shares are held in the name of an
intermediary on behalf of multiple investors, are a common form of holding
shares among retirement plans and financial intermediaries such as brokers,
advisers, and third-party administrators. Individual trades in omnibus accounts
are often not disclosed to the fund, making it difficult to determine whether a
particular shareholder is engaging in excessive trading. Excessive trading in
omnibus accounts is likely to go undetected by the fund and may increase costs
to the fund and disrupt its portfolio management. </P>
<P align=left>Under policies adopted by the Board of Trustees, intermediaries
will be permitted to apply the fund's excessive trading policy (described
above), or their own excessive trading policy if approved by the Adviser. In
these cases, the fund will typically not request or receive individual account
data but will rely on the intermediary to monitor trading activity in good faith
in accordance with its or the fund's policies. Reliance on intermediaries
increases the risk that excessive trading may go undetected. For other
intermediaries, the fund will generally monitor trading activity at the omnibus
account level to attempt to identify disruptive trades. The fund may request
transaction information, as frequently as daily, from any intermediary at any
time, and may apply the fund's policy to transactions that exceed thresholds
established by the Board of Trustees. The fund may prohibit purchases of fund
shares by an intermediary or by some or all of any intermediary's clients. There
is no assurance that the Adviser will request data with sufficient frequency to
detect or deter excessive trading in omnibus accounts effectively. </P>
<P align=left>If you purchase or sell fund shares through a financial
intermediary, you may wish to contact the intermediary to determine the policies
applicable to your account. </P>
<H3 align=left>Retirement Plans</H3>
<P align=left>For employer-sponsored retirement plans, only participant directed
exchanges count toward the roundtrip limits. Employer-sponsored retirement plan
participants whose activity triggers a purchase or exchange block will be
permitted one trade every calendar quarter. In the event of a block, employer
and participant contributions and loan repayments by the participant may still
be invested in the fund. </P>
<H3 align=left>Qualified Wrap Programs</H3>
<P align=left>The fund will monitor aggregate trading activity of adviser
transactions to attempt to identify excessive trading in qualified wrap
programs, as defined below. Excessive trading by an adviser will lead to fund
blocks and the wrap program will lose its qualified status. Transactions of an
adviser will not be matched with client-directed transactions unless the wrap
program ceases to be a qualified wrap program (but all client-directed
transactions will be subject to the fund's excessive trading policy). </P>
<P align=left>A qualified wrap program is: (i) a program whose adviser certifies
that it has investment discretion over $100 million or more in client assets
invested in mutual funds at the time of the certification, (ii) a program in
which the adviser directs transactions in the accounts participating in the
program in concert with changes in a model portfolio, and (iii) managed by an
adviser who agrees to give the Adviser sufficient information to permit the
Adviser to identify the individual accounts in the wrap program. </P>
<H3 align=left>Other Information about the Excessive Trading Policy</H3>
<P align=left>The fund's Treasurer is authorized to suspend the fund's policies
during periods of severe market turbulence or national emergency. The fund
reserves the right to modify its policies at any time without prior notice. </P>
<P align=left>The fund does not knowingly accommodate frequent purchases and
redemptions of fund shares by investors, except to the extent permitted by the
policies described above. </P>
<P align=left>In addition to these policies, each fund imposes a short-term
redemption fee on redemptions from the fund, which is discussed in "Selling
Shares." As described in "Valuing Shares," the fund also uses fair value pricing
to help reduce arbitrage opportunities available to short-term traders. There is
no assurance that the fund's excessive trading policy will be effective, or will
successfully detect or deter excessive or disruptive trading. </P>
<H3 align=left><A name=ref109217></A>Buying Shares</H3>
<P align=left>The price to buy one share is its NAV.
Shares are sold without a sales charge. </P>
<P align=left>Shares will be bought at the NAV next calculated after your
investment is received in proper form. </P>
<P align=left>Each fund has authorized certain intermediaries to accept orders
to buy shares on its behalf. When authorized intermediaries receive an order in
proper form, the order is considered as being placed with the fund, and shares
will be bought at the NAV next calculated after the order is received by the
authorized intermediary. Orders by funds of funds for which Financial serves as
investment manager will be treated as received by the fund at the same time that
the corresponding orders are received in proper form by the funds of funds. </P>
<!--
<H3 align=left>For Investor Class:</H3>
-->
<P align=left>There is no minimum balance or purchase minimum for investments
through Portfolio Advisory Services, a mutual fund or a qualified tuition
program for which Financial serves as investment manager, certain Financial
retirement accounts funded through salary deduction, or fund positions opened
with the proceeds of distributions from such retirement accounts or from a
Financial systematic withdrawal service. </P>
<!--
<H3 align=left>For Financial Advantage Class:</H3>
<P align=left>Employer-sponsored retirement plans (including profit sharing,
401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and similar plans) generally require a minimum purchase
and ongoing balance of $100 million at the plan sponsor level, except for plans
for which Financial provides recordkeeping services and which are marketed and
distributed directly to plan sponsors and participants without any assistance or
intervention from any intermediary distribution channel. </P>
-->
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left>For individual accounts maintained by the Adviser or its
affiliates, and for omnibus accounts for which Financial provides recordkeeping
services, the Adviser will monitor fund balances at the individual account
level. </P>
<!--
<P align=left>Financial Advantage Class shares are not available to
intermediaries that would meet the eligibility criteria by aggregating the
holdings of underlying accounts. An intermediary that holds Financial Advantage
Class shares within an omnibus account must certify to the Adviser or its
affiliates that it will be able to offer Financial Advantage Class shares in
accordance with the terms of this prospectus. Intermediaries may include
broker-dealers, institutional accounts, insurance, bank trust, third-party
administrators and registered investment advisers. </P>
-->
<P align=left>There is no minimum balance or purchase minimum for eligible
qualified wrap program accounts, or fund positions opened with the proceeds of
distributions from a Financial systematic withdrawal service. A qualified wrap
program is: (i)&nbsp;a program whose adviser certifies that it
has&nbsp;investment discretion over $100 million or more in client assets
invested in&nbsp;mutual funds at the time of the certification, (ii) a program
in which the adviser directs transactions in the accounts participating in the
program in concert with changes in a model portfolio, and (iii) managed by an
adviser who agrees to give the Adviser sufficient information to permit the
Adviser to identify the individual accounts in the wrap program. </P>
<!--
<P align=left>Financial Advantage Class shares are not available to mutual funds
or qualified tuition programs for which Financial serves as investment manager.
</P>
-->
<P align=left>In addition, each fund may waive or lower purchase minimums in
other circumstances. </P>
<P align=left>Shares are generally available only to investors residing in the
United States. </P>
<P align=left>Each fund may stop offering shares completely or may offer shares
only on a limited basis, for a period of time or permanently. </P>
<P align=left>If your payment is not received and collected, your purchase may
be canceled and you could be liable for any losses or fees a fund or Financial
has incurred. </P>
<P align=left>Certain financial institutions that have entered into sales
agreements with FDC may enter confirmed purchase orders on behalf of customers
by phone, with payment to follow no later than the time when
shares are priced on the following business day. If
payment is not received by that time, the order will be canceled and the
financial institution could be held liable for resulting fees or losses. </P>
<P align=left>Under applicable anti-money laundering rules and other
regulations, purchase orders may be suspended, restricted, or canceled and the
monies may be withheld. </P>
<H3 align=left><A name=ref109215></A>Selling Shares</H3>
<P align=left>The price to sell one share is its NAV, minus the short-term
redemption fee, if applicable. </P>
<P align=left>For Spartan Extended Market Index Fund, if you sell your shares
after holding them less than 90 days, a 0.75% short-term redemption fee may be
deducted from the redemption amount. For Spartan International Index Fund, if
you sell your shares after holding them less than 90 days, a 1.00% short-term
redemption fee may be deducted from the redemption amount. For Spartan Total
Market Index Fund, if you sell your shares after holding them less than 90 days,
a 0.50% short-term redemption fee may be deducted from the redemption amount.
For this purpose, shares held longest will be treated as being redeemed first
and shares held shortest as being redeemed last. The fees are paid to the funds,
not Financial, and are designed to help offset the brokerage commissions, market
impact, and other costs associated with short-term shareholder trading. </P>
<P align=left>The short-term redemption fee does not apply to: (i) redemptions
of shares acquired by reinvesting dividends and distributions;
(ii)&nbsp;rollovers, transfers, and changes of account registration within a
fund, or transfers between classes of a multiple class fund (if applicable) as
long as the money never leaves the fund; and (iii) redemptions in&nbsp;kind.
</P>
<P align=left>Each fund also permits waivers of the short-term redemption fee
for the following transactions: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Redemptions due to Financial fund small balance maintenance fees.
  <LI>Redemptions related to death or due to a divorce decree.
  <LI>Certain types of IRA account transactions, including: redemptions pursuant
  to systematic withdrawal programs, withdrawals due to disability, return of
  excess contribution amounts, and redemptions related to payment of custodian
  fees.
  <LI>Certain types of employer-sponsored and 403(b) retirement plan
  transactions, including: loans or hardship withdrawals, minimum required
  distributions, redemptions pursuant to systematic withdrawal programs,
  forfeiture of assets, return of excess contribution amounts, redemptions
  related to payment of plan fees, and redemptions related to death, disability,
  or qualified domestic relations order.
  <LI>Certain types of transactions in employer-sponsored and 403(b) retirement
  plans recordkept by Financial, including redemptions in conjunction with plan
  sponsor events and redemptions of shares purchased through plan sponsor
  events, plan contributions or loan repayments.
  <LI>Redemptions by qualified funds of funds and qualified wrap programs that
  meet certain criteria, such as advance notice requirements and restrictions on
  trading frequency, and are approved by the fund's treasurer. </LI></UL>
<P align=left>The application of short-term redemption fees and waivers may vary
among intermediaries and certain intermediaries may not apply the waivers listed
above. If you purchase or sell fund shares through an intermediary, you should
contact your intermediary for more information on whether the short-term
redemption fee will be applied to redemptions of your shares. </P>
<P align=right><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><B>Shareholder Information - continued</B> </P>
<P align=left>Each fund reserves the right to modify or eliminate the short-term
redemption fee or waivers at any time. Investment advisers or their affiliates
may pay short-term redemption fees on behalf of investors in managed accounts.
Unitized group accounts consisting of qualified plan assets may be treated as a
single account for redemption fee purposes. </P>
<P align=left>Financial seeks to identify intermediaries that hold fund shares in
omnibus accounts and will refuse their purchase orders if they do not agree to
track and remit short-term redemption fees based on the transactions of
underlying investors. There are no assurances that Financial will successfully
identify all intermediaries or that the intermediaries will properly assess
short-term redemption fees. </P>
<P align=left>Shares will be sold at the NAV next calculated after an order is
received in proper form, minus the short-term redemption fee, if applicable.
Normally, redemptions will be processed by the next business day, but it may
take up to seven days to pay the redemption proceeds if making immediate payment
would adversely affect a fund. </P>
<P align=left>Each fund has authorized certain intermediaries to accept orders
to sell shares on its behalf. When authorized intermediaries receive an order in
proper form, the order is considered as being placed with the fund, and shares
will be sold at the NAV next calculated after the order is received by the
authorized intermediary, minus the short-term redemption fee, if applicable.
Orders by funds of funds for which Financial serves as investment manager will be
treated as received by the fund at the same time that the corresponding orders
are received in proper form by the funds of funds. </P>
<P align=left>A signature guarantee is designed to protect you and Financial from
fraud. If you hold your shares in a Financial mutual fund account and submit your
request to Financial by mail, Financial may require that your request be made in
writing and include a signature guarantee in certain circumstances, such as:
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>When you wish to sell more than $100,000 worth of shares.
  <LI>When the address on your account (record address) has changed within the
  last 15 days or you are requesting that a check be mailed to an address
  different than the record address.
  <LI>When you are requesting that redemption proceeds be paid to someone other
  than the account owner.
  <LI>In certain situations when the redemption proceeds are being transferred
  to a Financial mutual fund account with a different registration. </LI></UL>
<P align=left>You should be able to obtain a signature guarantee from a bank,
broker (including Financial Investor Centers), dealer, credit union (if
authorized under state law), securities exchange or association, clearing
agency, or savings association. A notary public cannot provide a signature
guarantee. </P>
<P align=left>When you place an order to sell shares, note the following: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>If you are selling some but not all of your shares, keep your fund balance
  above the required minimum to keep your fund position open, except fund
  positions not subject to balance minimums.
  <LI>Redemption proceeds (other than exchanges) may be delayed until money from
  prior purchases sufficient to cover your redemption has been received and
  collected.
  <LI>Redemptions may be suspended or payment dates postponed when the NYSE is
  closed (other than weekends or holidays), when trading on the NYSE is
  restricted, or as permitted by the SEC.
  <LI>Redemption proceeds may be paid in securities or other property rather
  than in cash if the Adviser determines it is in the best interests of a fund.
  <LI>You will not receive interest on amounts represented by uncashed
  redemption checks.
  <LI>If you hold your shares in a Financial mutual fund account and your
  redemption check remains uncashed for six months, the check may be invested in
  additional shares at the NAV next calculated on the day of the investment.
  <LI>Under applicable anti-money laundering rules and other regulations,
  redemption requests may be suspended, restricted, canceled, or processed and
  the proceeds may be withheld. </LI></UL>

we believe are members of the same family who share the same address. We will
not send multiple copies of these documents to you and members of your family
who share the same address. Instead, we will send only a single copy of these
documents. This will continue for as long as you are a shareholder, unless you
notify us otherwise. If at any time you choose to receive individual copies of
any documents, please call 1-800-544-8544. We will begin sending individual
copies to you within 30 days of receiving your call. </P>

<P align=left><B>Shareholder Information - continued</B> </P>
<P align=left>Electronic copies of most financial reports and prospectuses are
available at Financial's web site. To participate in Financial's electronic
delivery program, call Financial or visit Financial's web site for more
information. </P>
<P align=left>You may initiate many<B> transactions by telephone or
electronically.</B> Financial will not be responsible for any loss, cost,
expense, or other liability resulting from unauthorized transactions if it
follows reasonable security procedures designed to verify the identity of the
investor. Financial will request personalized security codes or other
information, and may also record calls. For transactions conducted through the
Internet, Financial recommends the use of an Internet browser with 128-bit
encryption. You should verify the accuracy of your confirmation statements upon
receipt and notify Financial immediately of any discrepancies in your account
activity. If you do not want the ability to sell and exchange by telephone, call
Financial for instructions. </P>
<P align=left>You may also be asked to provide additional information in order
for Financial to verify your identity in accordance with requirements under
anti-money laundering regulations. Accounts may be restricted and/or closed, and
the monies withheld, pending verification of this information or as otherwise
required under these and other federal regulations. In addition, each fund
reserves the right to involuntarily redeem an account in the case of: (i) actual
or suspected threatening conduct or actual or suspected fraudulent, illegal or
suspicious activity by the account owner or any other individual associated with
the account; or (ii) the failure of the account owner to provide information to
the funds related to opening the accounts. Your shares will be sold at the NAV
minus, if applicable, any short-term redemption fee, calculated on the day
Financial closes your fund position. </P>
<P align=left>Financial may deduct a<B> small balance maintenance fee</B> of
$12.00 from a fund balance with a value of less than $2,000 in shares. It is
expected that fund balances will be valued after November 1 but prior to
December 31 of each calendar year. Fund positions opened after September 30 will
not be subject to the fee for that calendar year. The fee, which is payable to
Financial, is designed to offset in part the relatively higher costs of servicing
smaller fund positions. This fee will not be deducted from fund positions opened
after January 1 of that calendar year if those positions use certain regular
investment plans. </P>
<P align=left>If your<B> fund balance </B>falls below $2,000 worth of shares
($500 for fund balances in Financial Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, and
Investment Only Retirement accounts) for any reason, including solely due to
declines in NAV, and you do not increase your balance, Financial may sell all of
your shares and send the proceeds to you after providing you with at least 30
days' notice to reestablish the minimum balance. Your shares will be sold at the
NAV, minus the short-term redemption fee, if applicable, on the day Financial
closes your fund position. Certain fund positions are not subject to these
balance requirements and will not be closed for failure to maintain a minimum
balance. </P>
<P align=left>Financial may charge a<B> fee for certain services,</B> such as
providing historical account documents. </P>

name=sib156367>Dividends and Capital Gain Distributions</A></H2>
<P align=left>Each fund earns dividends, interest, and other income from its
investments, and distributes this income (less expenses) to shareholders as
dividends. Each fund also realizes capital gains from its investments, and
distributes these gains (less any losses) to shareholders as capital gain
distributions. </P>
<P align=left>Each fund normally pays dividends and capital gain distributions
in April and December. </P>
<H3 align=left><A name=ref109191></A>Distribution Options</H3>
<P align=left>When you open an account, specify on your application how you want
to receive your distributions. The following distribution options are available:
</P>
<P align=left><B>1. Reinvestment Option.</B> Any dividends and capital gain
distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares. If you do
not indicate a choice on your application, you will be assigned this option.
</P>
<P align=left><B>2. Income-Earned Option.</B> Any capital gain distributions
will be automatically reinvested in additional shares. Any dividends will be
paid in cash. </P>
<P align=left><B>3. Cash Option.</B> Any dividends and capital gain
distributions will be paid in cash. </P>
<P align=left><B>4. Directed Dividends</B><SUP>Â®</SUP><B> Option.</B> Any
dividends will be automatically invested in shares of another identically
registered Financial fund. Any capital gain distributions will be automatically
invested in shares of another identically registered Financial fund,
automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund, or paid in cash. </P>
<P align=left>Not all distribution options may be available for every account
and certain restrictions may apply. If the distribution option you prefer is not
listed on your account application, or if you want to change your current
distribution option, visit Financial's web site at www.Financial.com or call
1-800-544-6666 for more information. </P>
<P align=left>If you elect to receive distributions paid in cash by check and
the U.S. Postal Service does not deliver your checks, your distribution option
may be converted to the Reinvestment Option. You will not receive interest on
amounts represented by uncashed distribution checks. </P>
<P align=left>If your dividend check(s) remains uncashed for six months, your
check(s) may be invested in additional shares at the NAV next calculated on the
day of the investment. </P>

name=sib156368>Tax Consequences</A></H2>
<P align=left>As with any investment, your investment in a fund could have
tax&nbsp;consequences for you. If you are not investing through a tax-advantaged
retirement account, you should consider these tax consequences. </P>
<P align=left><B>Taxes on distributions.</B> Distributions you receive from each
fund are subject to federal income tax, and may also be subject to state or
local taxes. </P>
<P align=left>For federal tax purposes, certain of each fund's distributions,
including dividends and distributions of short-term capital gains, are taxable
to you as ordinary income, while certain of each fund's distributions, including
distributions of long-term capital gains, are taxable to you generally as
capital gains. A percentage of certain distributions of dividends may qualify
for taxation at long-term capital gains rates (provided certain holding period
requirements are met). </P>
<P align=left>If you buy shares when a fund has realized but not yet distributed
income or capital gains, you will be "buying a dividend" by paying the full
price for the shares and then receiving a portion of the price back in the form
of a taxable distribution. </P>
<P align=left>Any taxable distributions you receive from a fund will normally be
taxable to you when you receive them, regardless of your distribution option.
</P>
<P align=left><B>Taxes on transactions.</B> Your redemptions, including
exchanges, may result in a capital gain or loss for federal tax purposes. A
capital gain or loss on your investment in a fund generally is the difference
between the cost of your shares and the price you receive when you sell them.

name=sib156369>Fund Management</A></H2>
<P align=left>Each fund is a mutual fund, an investment that pools shareholders'
money and invests it toward a specified goal. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser is each fund's manager. The address of the Adviser and
its affiliates, unless otherwise indicated below, is 245 Summer Street, Boston,
Massachusetts 02210. </P>
<P align=left>As of December 31, 2014, the Adviser had approximately
$765.9&nbsp;million in discretionary assets under management, and approximately
$2.03 trillion when combined with all of its affiliates' assets under
management. </P>
<P align=left>Pursuant to an SEC exemptive order, the Adviser intends to act as
a manager of managers, meaning that the Adviser has the responsibility to
oversee sub-advisers and recommend their hiring, termination, and replacement.
Subject to approval by the Board of Trustees but without shareholder approval,
the Adviser may replace or hire unaffiliated sub-advisers or amend the terms of
their existing sub-advisory agreements, if any. In the event of approval of a
new unaffiliated sub-adviser, you will be provided with information about the
new sub-adviser and sub-advisory agreement within ninety days of appointment.
</P>
<P align=left>As the manager, the Adviser is responsible for handling each
fund's business affairs. </P>
<P align=left>Geode, at One Post Office Square, 20th Floor, Boston,
Massachusetts 02109, serves as a sub-adviser for each fund. Geode chooses each
fund's investments and places orders to buy and sell each fund's investments.
</P>
<P align=left>As of December 31, 2014, Geode had approximately $193.4 billion in
discretionary assets under management. </P>

he has managed since September 2014. He also manages other funds. Since joining
Geode in 2014, Mr. Gyllenhaal has worked as a senior portfolio manager. Prior to
joining Geode, Mr. Gyllenhaal was a senior portfolio manager at Hartford
Investment Management from 2006 to 2014. </P>
<P align=left>Patrick Waddell is a senior portfolio manager of each fund, which
he has managed since February 2004. He also manages other funds. Since joining
Geode in 2004, Mr. Waddell has worked as an assistant portfolio manager,
portfolio manager, and senior portfolio manager. </P>
<P align=left>Louis Bottari is portfolio manager of each fund, which he has
managed since January 2009. He also manages other funds. Since joining Geode in
2008, Mr. Bottari has worked as an assistant portfolio manager and portfolio
manager. </P>
<P align=left>Peter Matthew is assistant portfolio manager of each fund, which
he has managed since August 2012. He also manages other funds. Since joining
Geode in 2007, Mr. Matthew has worked as a senior operations associate,
portfolio manager assistant, and assistant portfolio manager. </P>
<P align=left>The statement of additional information (SAI) provides additional
information about the compensation of, any other accounts managed by, and any
fund shares held by the portfolio managers. </P>
<P align=left>Each fund pays a management fee to the Adviser. The management fee
is calculated and paid to the Adviser every month. The Adviser pays all of the
other expenses of each fund with certain exceptions. </P>
<P align=left>Spartan Extended Market Index Fund's, Spartan International Index
Fund's, and Spartan Total Market Index Fund's annual management fee rate is
0.06%, 0.06%, and 0.035%, respectively, of its average net assets. </P>
<P align=left>On July 1, 2014, the Adviser reduced the management fee rate for
Spartan Total Market Index Fund from 0.045% to 0.035%. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser pays FMRC for providing sub-advisory services. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser pays Geode for providing investment management
services. </P>
<P align=left>The basis for the Board of Trustees approving the management
contract and sub-advisory agreements for each fund is available in each fund's
semi-annual report for the fiscal period ended August&nbsp;31, 2014. </P>
<P align=left>From time to time, the Adviser or its affiliates may agree to
reimburse or waive certain fund expenses while retaining the ability to be
repaid if expenses fall below the specified limit prior to the end of the fiscal
year. </P>
<P align=left>Reimbursement or waiver arrangements can decrease expenses and
boost performance. </P>

<P align=left>Each fund is composed of multiple classes of shares. All classes
of a fund have a common investment objective and investment portfolio. </P>
<P align=left>FDC distributes each class's shares. </P>
<P align=left>Intermediaries may receive from the Adviser, FDC, and/or their
affiliates compensation for providing recordkeeping and administrative services,
as well as other retirement plan expenses, and compensation for services
intended to result in the sale of class shares. This compensation may take the
form of payments for additional distribution-related activities and/or
shareholder services and payments for educational seminars and training,
including seminars sponsored by Financial, or by an intermediary. These payments
are described in more detail in this section and in the SAI. </P>
<P align=left>The fund has adopted a
Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to Rule 12b-1 under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) that recognizes that the Adviser may use its
management fee revenues, as well as its past profits or its resources from any
other source, to pay FDC for expenses incurred in connection with providing
services intended to result in the sale of
shares and/or shareholder support services. The Adviser, directly or
through FDC, may pay significant amounts to intermediaries that provide those
services. Currently, the Board of Trustees of each fund has authorized such
payments. Please speak with your
investment professional to learn more about any payments his or her firm may
receive from the Adviser, FDC, and/or their affiliates, as well as fees and/or
commissions the investment professional charges. You should also consult
disclosures made by your investment professional at the time of purchase. </P>
<P align=right><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><B>Fund Services - continued</B> </P>
<P align=left>If payments made by the Adviser to FDC or to intermediaries under
a Distribution and Service Plan were considered to be paid out of a class's
assets on an ongoing basis, they might increase the cost of your investment and
might cost you more than paying other types of sales charges. </P>
<P align=left>From time to time, FDC may offer special promotional programs to
investors who purchase shares of Financial funds. For example, FDC may offer
merchandise, discounts, vouchers, or similar items to investors who purchase
shares of certain Financial funds during certain periods. To determine if you
qualify for any such programs, contact Financial or visit our web site at
www.Financial.com. </P>
<P align=left>No dealer, sales representative, or any other person has been

those contained in this prospectus and in the related SAI, in connection with
the offer contained in this prospectus. If given or made, such other information
or representations must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the
funds or FDC. This prospectus and the related SAI do not constitute an offer by
the funds or by FDC to sell shares of the funds to or to buy shares of the funds

<P align=left>Financial Highlights are intended to help you understand the
financial history of fund shares for the past 5 years (or, if shorter, the
period of operations). Certain information reflects financial results for a
single share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor
would have earned (or lost) on an investment in shares (assuming reinvestment of
all dividends and&nbsp;distributions). The annual information has been audited
by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm,
whose report, along with fund financial statements, is included in the annual
report. Annual reports are available for free upon request. </P>
