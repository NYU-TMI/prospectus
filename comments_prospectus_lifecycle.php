<H3 id=ffk.html.53 align=left>Portfolio Turnover</H3>
<P align=left>The fund will not incur transaction costs, such as commissions, 
when it buys and sells shares of underlying Financial<SUP>®</SUP> funds (or 
"turns over" its portfolio), but it could incur transaction costs if it were to 
buy and sell other types of securities directly. If the fund were to buy and 
sell other types of securities directly, a higher portfolio turnover rate could 
indicate higher transaction costs and could result in higher taxes when fund 
shares are held in a taxable account. Such costs, if incurred, would not be 
reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example and would affect the 
fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio 
turnover rate was 17% of the average value of its portfolio. </P>

  the Financial Freedom K Income Fund (approximately 17% in domestic equity

</P>
<UL>
  <LI>Strategic Advisers mayuse an active asset allocation strategy to 
  increase or decrease neutral asset class exposures reflected above by up to 10 
  percentage points for Equity Funds (includes domestic equity and international 
  equity funds), Bond Funds and Short-Term Funds to reflect Strategic Advisers' 
  market outlook, which is primarily focused on the intermediate term. The asset 
  allocations in the glide path and pie chart above are referred to as "neutral" 
  because they do not reflect any decisions made by Strategic Advisers to 
  overweight or underweight an asset class. 
  <LI>Strategic Advisers may also make active asset allocations within other 
  asset classes (including Commodities, High Yield Debt, Floating Rate Debt, 
  Real Estate Debt, Inflation-Protected Debt, and Emerging Markets Debt) from 0% 
  to 10% individually but no more than 25% in aggregate within those other asset 
  classes. &nbsp;Such asset classes are not reflected in the neutral asset 
  allocations reflected in the glide path and pie chart above. 
  <LI>Designed for investors who anticipate retiring in or within a few years 
  of 2050 (target retirement date) at or around age 65 and plan to gradually 
  withdraw the value of their account in the fund over time. </LI></UL>
<H2 align=left><A name=ref328415></A>Principal Investment Risks</H2>
<P align=left><I>Shareholders should consider that no target date fund is 
intended as a complete retirement program and there is no guarantee that any 
single fund will provide sufficient retirement income at or through your 
retirement. The fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money 
by investing in the fund, including losses near, at or after the target 
retirement date.</I> </P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Asset Allocation Risk. </I>The fund is subject to risks resulting from 
  the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. The selection of underlying funds 
  and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset classes could 
  cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant benchmarks or 
  other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's active asset 
  allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile different than 
  that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses. 
  <LI><I>Investing in Other Funds.</I> The fund bears all risks of investment 
  strategies employed by the underlying funds, including the risk that the 
  underlying funds will not meet their investment objectives. 
  <LI><I>Stock Market Volatility.</I> Stock markets are volatile and can decline 
  significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or 
  economic developments. Different parts of the market, including different 
  market sectors, and different types of securities can react differently to 
  these developments. </LI></UL>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Interest Rate Changes.</I> Interest rate increases can cause the price 
  of a debt or money market security to decrease. 
  <LI><I>Foreign Exposure.</I> Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, 
  can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse 
  issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can 
  perform differently from the U.S. market. Emerging markets can be subject to 
  greater social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties and can be 
  extremely volatile. Foreign exchange rates also can be extremely volatile. 
  <LI><I>Industry Exposure.</I> Market conditions, interest rates, and economic, 
  regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a single 
  industry or group of related industries. 
  <LI><I>Issuer-Specific Changes.</I> The value of an individual security or 
  particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform 
  differently from, the market as a whole. Lower-quality debt securities (those 
  of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt 
  securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities involve 
  greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in the credit quality 
  of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and certain types of 
  other securities can be more volatile due to increased sensitivity to adverse 
  issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments. 
  <LI><I>"Growth" Investing.</I> "Growth" stocks can perform differently from 
  the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can be more volatile than 
  other types of stocks. 
  <LI><I>"Value" Investing.</I> "Value" stocks can perform differently from the 
  market as a whole and other types of stocks and can continue to be undervalued 
  by the market for long periods of time. 
  <LI><I>Commodity-Linked Investing.</I> The value of commodities and 
  commodity-linked investments may be affected by the performance of the overall 
  commodities markets as well as weather, political, tax, and other regulatory 
  and market developments. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile and 
  less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures. </LI></UL>

<P align=left><B><I>Principal Investment Strategies</I></B> </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser invests each fund's assets in a combination of 
Financial funds: domestic equity funds, international equity funds (developed and 
emerging markets), bond funds, and short-term funds (underlying Financial funds). 
The funds differ primarily due to their asset allocations among these fund 
types. Because each fund allocates its assets among the underlying Financial 
funds based on fund types rather than on the actual holdings of the underlying 
Financial funds, each fund may have greater exposure to an asset class to the 
extent that an underlying Financial fund holds securities of more than one asset 
class. The neutral asset allocation strategy for each fund is designed to 
provide an approach to asset allocation that is neither overly aggressive nor 
overly conservative. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser allocates the assets of each fund (except Financial 
Freedom K<SUP>®</SUP> Income Fund) among underlying Financial funds according to 
a neutral asset allocation strategy that becomes increasingly conservative over 
time. Each fund's name refers to the approximate retirement year of the 
investors for whom the fund's asset allocation strategy is designed. For 
example, Financial Freedom K<SUP>®</SUP> 2060 Fund, which is designed for 
investors planning to retire around the year 2060 and at or around age 65, has a 
relatively aggressive neutral asset allocation, with a substantial portion of 
its assets invested in domestic equity funds and international equity funds and 
a modest portion of its assets invested in bond funds. By contrast, Financial 
Freedom K<SUP>®</SUP> 2005 Fund, which has reached its target retirement year, 
has a more conservative neutral asset allocation, with less than half of its 
assets invested in domestic equity funds and international equity funds and the 
majority of its assets invested in bond funds and short-term funds. </P>
<P align=left>Financial Freedom K<SUP>®</SUP> Income Fund is designed for 
investors in their retirement years. The Adviser allocates the fund's assets 
according to a stable neutral asset allocation that emphasizes bond funds and 
short-term funds but also includes a small amount of domestic equity funds and 
international equity funds. </P>
<P align=left><I>Active Asset Allocation.</I> The "neutral" asset allocation in 
each fund summary represents the Adviser's view regarding how each fund's 
investments should be allocated among the various asset classes over the long 
term. Each fund's actual allocations may differ to the extent the Adviser 
employs its active allocation strategy. As discussed in each fund's summary, the 
active asset allocation strategy allows the Adviser to increase or decrease 
neutral asset class exposures by up to 10 percentage points for Equity Funds 
(includes domestic equity and international equity funds), Bond Funds and 
Short-Term Funds, to reflect the Adviser's market outlook, which is primarily 
focused on the intermediate term (active asset allocation strategy). At no time, 
however, will a fund's investments in domestic and international equity funds 
equal 95%. </P>
<P align=left>The following table lists the approximate asset class allocation 
ranges for each fund as of March 31, 2015. The Adviser may change these 
percentages over time. </P>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>

<P align=left>When increasing or decreasing asset allocation to one or more 
asset classes, the Adviser will correspondingly reduce or increase exposure to 
the remaining asset classes. For example, if the Adviser's intermediate term 
market outlook was to favor fixed income securities, the Adviser may choose to 
increase each fund's asset allocation to underlying bond funds by up to 10 
percentage points from each fund's neutral asset allocation to bond funds, by 
correspondingly reducing asset allocation to domestic and international equity 
funds and/or short-term funds. Conversely, if fixed income investments were to 
fall out of favor based on the Adviser's intermediate term market outlook, the 
Adviser may choose to decrease exposures to underlying bond funds by increasing 
asset allocation to underlying domestic and/or international equity funds and/or 
short-term funds. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser may also make active asset allocations within other 
asset classes (including Commodities, High Yield Debt, Floating Rate Debt, Real 
Estate Debt, Inflation-Protected Debt, and Emerging Markets Debt) from 0% to 10% 
individually, but no more than 25% in aggregate within those other asset 
classes. Such asset classes are not reflected in the neutral asset allocations. 
</P>
<P align=left>Information concerning each fund's actual allocations to 
underlying funds will be available in each fund's shareholder report and on the 
funds' website from time to time. </P>
<P align=left><I>Selecting a Financial Freedom K Fund</I> </P>
<P align=left>There are many considerations relevant to fund selection, 
including your individual income replacement goals (i.e. how much income do you 
expect to need in retirement), other expected income after retirement, 
inflation, other assets and risk tolerance. You should also consider that no 
target date fund is intended as a complete retirement program and there is no 
guarantee that any single fund or a collection of funds will provide sufficient 
income in your retirement years. When selecting a fund, in addition to the 
considerations discussed above, you may wish to consider a fund with a target 
year near the year in which you anticipate your retirement to begin, having 
reached the age of at or around 65. It is important to note that the funds' 
asset allocation strategy is designed to provide income for shareholders through 
their retirement years and assumes that an investor will withdraw the value of 
his or her account gradually after retirement. Meeting your retirement goals is 
dependent upon many factors, including the amount you save and the period over 
which you do so. Investors should select the fund that best meets their 
individual circumstances and investment goals. </P>

<P align=left>The following chart illustrates how each fund's approximate asset

and short-term funds is expected to change over time. The funds' actual asset

<P align=left><IMG alt=kkf548377 src="img/kkf548361.jpg"> <BR></P>
<P align=left>The neutral allocations shown in the glide path do not reflect any

class based on its market outlook. Each fund's asset allocation assigned to the

forth in the glide path by more than plus (+) or minus (-) 10 percentage points.

<P align=left>When the neutral asset allocation of a fund matches Financial

Fund, without shareholder approval, and the fund's shareholders will become 
shareholders of Financial Freedom K<FONT size=-2><SUP>®</SUP></FONT> Income Fund. 
</P>
<P align=left>The Adviser may modify the neutral asset allocation strategy and 
the active asset allocation strategy for any fund from time to time. </P>
<P align=left><B><I>Description of Underlying Financial Funds</I></B> </P>
<P align=left></P>
<P align=left>Each fund invests in underlying Financial funds. Although the 
underlying Financial funds are categorized generally as domestic equity, 
international equity, bond, and short-term funds, many of the underlying 
Financial funds may invest in a mix of securities of foreign and domestic 
issuers, investment-grade and high yield bonds, and other securities. Many of 
the underlying Financial funds may also use various techniques, such as buying 
and selling futures contracts and exchange traded funds, to increase or decrease 
a fund's exposure to changing security prices or other factors that affect 
security values. Each fund will purchase Class F shares of any underlying 
Financial fund that offers Class F shares. The Adviser may modify the selection 
of underlying Financial funds for any fund from time to time. When modifying the 
selection of underlying Financial funds and transitioning in or out of one or 
more underlying Financial funds, the Adviser may invest a fund's assets directly 
in securities for a period of time. </P>
<P align=left>A brief description of the underlying Financial funds each fund may 
utilize as of the date of this prospectus, is provided in the funds' Statement 
of Additional Information (SAI). More detailed information about each underlying 
Financial fund is available in each underlying Financial fund's prospectus. </P>

<P align=left>Many factors affect each fund's performance. A fund's share price 
changes daily based on the performance of the underlying Financial funds in which 
it invests. The ability of each fund to meet its investment objective is 
directly related to its asset allocation among underlying Financial funds and the 
ability of those funds to meet their investment objectives. If the Adviser's 
asset allocation strategy does not work as intended, a fund may not achieve its 
objective. Shareholders should consider that no target date fund is intended as 
a complete retirement program and there is no guarantee that any single fund 
will provide sufficient retirement income at or through your retirement. The 
fund's share price fluctuates, which means you could lose money by investing in 
the fund, including losses near, at, or after the target retirement date. </P>
<P align=left>The following factors can significantly affect a fund's 
performance: </P>
<P align=left><I>Asset Allocation Risk.</I><I> </I>The fund is subject to risks 
resulting from the Adviser's asset allocation decisions. The selection of 
underlying funds and the allocation of the fund's assets among various asset 
classes could cause the fund to lose value or its results to lag relevant 
benchmarks or other funds with similar objectives. In addition, the fund's 
active asset allocation strategy may cause the fund to have a risk profile 
different than that portrayed above from time to time and may increase losses. 
</P>
<P align=left><I>Investing in Other Funds.</I><I> </I>A fund bears all risks of 
investment strategies employed by the underlying funds. A fund does not control 
the investments of the underlying funds, which may have different investment 
objectives and may engage in investment strategies that a fund would not engage 
in directly. Aggregation of underlying fund holdings may result in indirect 
concentration of assets in a particular industry or group of industries, or in a 
single issuer, which may increase volatility. </P>
<P align=left><I>Stock Market Volatility.</I> The value of equity securities 
fluctuates in response to issuer, political, market, and economic developments. 
Fluctuations, especially in foreign markets, can be dramatic over the short as 
well as long term, and different parts of the market, including different market 
sectors, and different types of equity securities can react differently to these 
developments. For example, stocks of companies in one sector can react 
differently from those in another, large cap stocks can react differently from 
small cap stocks, "growth" stocks can react differently from "value" stocks, and 
stocks selected using quantitative or technical analysis can react differently 
than stocks selected using fundamental analysis. Issuer, political, or economic 
developments can affect a single issuer, issuers within an industry or economic 
sector or geographic region, or the market as a whole. Changes in the financial 
condition of a single issuer can impact the market as a whole. Terrorism and 
related geo-political risks have led, and may in the future lead, to increased 
short-term market volatility and may have adverse long-term effects on world 
economies and markets generally. </P>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><I>Floating Rate Loan Trading.</I> The value of the collateral 
securing a floating rate loan can decline, be insufficient to meet the 
obligations of the borrower, or be difficult to liquidate. As a result, a 
floating rate loan may not be fully collateralized and can decline significantly 
in value. Floating rate loans generally are subject to legal or contractual 
restrictions on resale. The liquidity of floating rate loans, including the 
volume and frequency of secondary market trading in such loans, varies 
significantly over time and among individual floating rate loans. For example, 
if the credit quality of a floating rate loan unexpectedly declines 
significantly, secondary market trading in that floating rate loan can also 
decline for a period of time. During periods of infrequent trading, valuing a 
floating rate loan can be more difficult, and buying and selling a floating rate 
loan at an acceptable price can be more difficult and delayed. Difficulty in 
selling a floating rate loan can result in a loss. </P>
<P align=left><I>Interest Rate Changes.</I> Debt securities, including money 
market securities, have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest 
rates. In general, the price of a debt security can fall when interest rates 
rise and can rise when interest rates fall. Securities with longer maturities 
and certain types of securities, such as mortgage securities and the securities 
of issuers in the financial services sector, can be more sensitive to interest 
rate changes, meaning the longer the maturity of a security, the greater the 
impact a change in interest rates could have on the security's price. Short-term 
and long-term interest rates do not necessarily move in the same amount or the 
same direction. Short-term securities tend to react to changes in short-term 
interest rates, and long-term securities tend to react to changes in long-term 
interest rates. Securities with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to 
interest rate changes, but may decline in value if their interest rates do not 
rise as much as interest rates in general. Securities whose payment at maturity 
is based on the movement of all or part of an index and inflation-protected debt 
securities may react differently from other types of debt securities. </P>
<P align=left><I>Foreign Exposure.</I> Foreign securities, foreign currencies, 
and securities issued by U.S. entities with substantial foreign operations, and 
securities for which an entity located in a foreign country provides credit 
support or a maturity-shortening structure can involve additional risks relating 
to political, economic, or regulatory conditions in foreign countries.<I> 
</I>These risks include fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; withholding or 
other taxes; trading, settlement, custodial, and other operational risks; and 
the less stringent investor protection and disclosure standards of some foreign 
markets.<I> </I>All of these factors can make foreign investments, especially 
those in emerging markets, more volatile and potentially less liquid than U.S. 
investments.<I> </I>In addition, foreign markets can perform differently from 
the U.S. market. </P>
<P align=left>Investing in emerging markets can involve risks in addition to and 
greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign 
markets. The extent of economic development; political stability; market depth, 
infrastructure, and capitalization; and regulatory oversight can be less than in 
more developed markets. Emerging market economies can be subject to greater 
social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties. All of these factors 
can make emerging market securities more volatile and potentially less liquid 
than securities issued in more developed markets. </P>
<P align=left>Global economies and financial markets are becoming increasingly 
interconnected, which increases the possibilities that conditions in one country 
or region might adversely impact issuers or providers in, or foreign exchange 
rates with, a different country or region. </P>
<P align=left><I>Industry Exposure.</I> Market conditions, interest rates, and 
economic, regulatory, or financial developments could significantly affect a 
single industry or a group of related industries, and the securities of 
companies in that industry or group of industries could react similarly to these 
or other developments. In addition, from time to time, a small number of 
companies may represent a large portion of a single industry or a group of 
related industries as a whole, and these companies can be sensitive to adverse 
economic, regulatory, or financial developments. </P>
<P align=left>The <I>commodities</I> industries can be significantly affected by 
the level and volatility of commodity prices; the rate of commodity consumption; 
world events including international monetary and political developments; import 
controls, export controls, and worldwide competition; exploration and production 
spending; and tax and other government regulations and economic conditions. </P>
<P align=left>Companies in the <I>financial services</I> industries are highly 
dependent on the supply of short-term financing. The value of securities of 
issuers in the financial services industries can be sensitive to changes in 
government regulation and interest rates and to economic downturns in the United 
States and abroad. </P>
<P align=left>The <I>real estate</I> industry is particularly sensitive to 
economic downturns. The value of securities of issuers in the real estate 
industry, including REITs, can be affected by changes in real estate values and 
rental income, property taxes, interest rates, tax and regulatory requirements, 
and the management skill and creditworthiness of the issuer. In addition, the 
value of a REIT can depend on the structure of and cash flow generated by the 
REIT, and REITs may not have diversified holdings. Because REITs are pooled 
investment vehicles that have expenses of their own, the fund will indirectly 
bear its proportionate share of those expenses. </P>
<P align=right><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=justify><B>Fund Basics - continued</B> </P>
<P align=left><I>Subsidiary Risk.</I> The investments held by the Subsidiary are 
generally similar to those that are permitted to be held by the underlying fund 
that invests in it and, therefore, the Subsidiary is subject to risks similar to 
those of such fund, including the risks associated with investing in derivatives 
and commodity-linked investing in general. Because the Subsidiary is organized 
under Cayman Islands law and is not registered under the 1940 Act, the 
Subsidiary is not subject to the investor protections of the 1940 Act. The 
underlying fund that invests in the Subsidiary relies on a private letter ruling 
received by other Financial funds from the Internal Revenue Service with respect 
to its investment in the Subsidiary. Changes in U.S. or Cayman Islands laws 
could result in the inability of such fund and/or the Subsidiary to operate as 
described in this prospectus. </P>
<P align=left><I>Prepayment.</I> Many types of debt securities, including 
mortgage securities, inflation-protected debt securities, and floating rate 
loans, are subject to prepayment risk. Prepayment risk occurs when the issuer of 
a security can repay principal prior to the security's maturity. Securities 
subject to prepayment can offer less potential for gains during a declining 
interest rate environment or when the credit quality of an issuer improves and 
similar or greater potential for loss in a rising interest rate environment. In 
addition, the potential impact of prepayment features on the price of a debt 
security can be difficult to predict and result in greater volatility. </P>
<P align=left><I>Issuer-Specific Changes.</I> Changes in the financial condition 
of an issuer or counterparty, changes in specific economic or political 
conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer, and changes in 
general economic or political conditions can increase the risk of default by an 
issuer or counterparty, which can affect a security's or instrument's credit 
quality or value and an issuer's or counterparty's ability to pay interest and 
principal when due. Entities providing credit support or a maturity-shortening 
structure also can be affected by these types of changes, and if the structure 
of a security fails to function as intended, the security could decline in 
value. Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade 
quality, also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds), 
including floating rate loans, and certain types of other securities tend to be 
particularly sensitive to these changes. </P>
<P align=left>Lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other 
securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in 
the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and 
certain types of other securities often fluctuates in response to company, 
political, or economic developments and can decline significantly over short as 
well as long periods of time or during periods of general or regional economic 
difficulty. Lower-quality debt securities can be thinly traded or have 
restrictions on resale, making them difficult to sell at an acceptable price, 
and often are considered to be speculative. The default rate for lower-quality 
debt securities is likely to be higher during economic recessions or periods of 
high interest rates. </P>
<P align=left><I>Correlation to Index.</I> The performance of an underlying 
index fund and its index may vary somewhat due to factors such as fees and 
expenses of the underlying fund, imperfect correlation between the underlying 
fund's securities and those in its index, timing differences associated with 
additions to and deletions from the index, and changes in the shares outstanding 
of the component securities. An underlying index fund may not be fully invested 
at times, either as a result of cash flows into the underlying fund or as a 
result of reserves of cash held by the underlying fund to meet redemptions. The 
use of sampling techniques or futures or other derivative positions may affect 
an underlying index fund's ability to achieve close correlation with its index. 
</P>
<P align=left><I>Leverage Risk.</I> Derivatives and forward-settling securities 
involve leverage because they can provide investment exposure in an amount 
exceeding the initial investment. Leverage can magnify investment risks and 
cause losses to be realized more quickly. A small change in the underlying 
asset, instrument, or index can lead to a significant loss. Assets segregated to 
cover these transactions may decline in value and are not available to meet 
redemptions. Forward-settling securities also involve the risk that a security 
will not be issued, delivered, or paid for when anticipated. Government 
legislation or regulation could affect the use of these transactions and could 
limit a fund's ability to pursue its investment strategies. </P>
<P align=left><I>"Growth" Investing.</I> "Growth" stocks can react differently 
to issuer, political, market, and economic developments than the market as a 
whole and other types of stocks. "Growth" stocks tend to be more expensive 
relative to their earnings or assets compared to other types of stocks. As a 
result, "growth" stocks tend to be sensitive to changes in their earnings and 
more volatile than other types of stocks. </P>
<P align=left><I>"Value" Investing.</I> "Value" stocks can react differently to 
issuer, political, market, and economic developments than the market as a whole 
and other types of stocks. "Value" stocks tend to be inexpensive relative to 
their earnings or assets compared to other types of stocks. However, "value" 
stocks can continue to be inexpensive for long periods of time and may not ever 
realize their full value. </P>
<P align=left><I>Inflation-Protected Debt Exposure.</I> Inflation-protected debt 
securities tend to react to changes in real interest rates. Real interest rates 
represent nominal (stated) interest rates reduced by the expected impact of 
inflation. In general, the price of an inflation-protected debt security can 
fall when real interest rates rise, and can rise when real interest rates fall. 
Interest payments on inflation-protected debt securities can be unpredictable 
and will vary as the principal and/or interest is adjusted for inflation. </P>
<P align=left><I>Small Cap Investing.</I> The value of securities of smaller, 
less well-known issuers can be more volatile than that of larger issuers and can 
react differently to issuer, political, market, and economic developments than 
the market as a whole and other types of stocks. Smaller issuers can have more 
limited product lines, markets, and financial resources. </P>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><I>Commodity-Linked Investing.</I> The performance of commodities, 
commodity-linked swaps, futures, notes, and other commodity-related investments 
may depend on the performance of the overall commodities markets and on other 
factors that affect the value of commodities, including weather, political, tax, 
and other regulatory and market developments. Commodity-linked instruments may 
be leveraged. For example, the price of a three-times leveraged commodity-linked 
note may change by a magnitude of three for every percentage change (positive or 
negative) in the value of the underlying index. Commodity-linked investments may 
be hybrid instruments that can have substantial risk of loss with respect to 
both principal and interest. Commodity-linked investments may be more volatile 
and less liquid than the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures, are 
subject to the credit risks associated with the issuer, and their values may 
decline substantially if the issuer's creditworthiness deteriorates. As a 
result, returns of commodity-linked investments may deviate significantly from 
the return of the underlying commodity, instruments, or measures. </P>
<P align=left>In response to market, economic, political, or other conditions, a 
fund may temporarily use a different investment strategy for defensive purposes. 
If the fund does so, different factors could affect its performance and the fund 
may not achieve its investment objective. </P>
<H3 align=left>Fundamental Investment Policies</H3>
<P align=left>The following is fundamental, that is, subject to change only by 
shareholder approval: </P>
<P align=left><B class="fund-name"></B> 
seeks high total return until its 
target retirement date. Thereafter the fund's objective will be to seek high 
current income and, as a secondary objective, capital appreciation. </P>
<H2 align=left><A name=MS_BT_150601155823>Valuing Shares</A></H2>
<P align=left>Each fund is open for business each day the NYSE is open. </P>
<P align=left>NAV is the value of a single share. Financial normally calculates 
NAV as of the close of business of the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. 
Each fund's assets normally are valued as of this time for the purpose of 
computing NAV. </P>
<P align=left>NAV is not calculated and a fund will not process purchase and 
redemption requests submitted on days when the fund is not open for business. 
The time at which shares are priced and until which purchase and redemption 
orders are accepted may be changed as permitted by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission (SEC). </P>
<P align=left>NAV is calculated using the values of the underlying Financial 
funds in which a fund invests. Shares of underlying Financial funds are valued at 
their respective NAVs. For an explanation of the circumstances under which the 
underlying Financial funds will use fair value pricing and the effects of using 
fair value pricing, see the underlying Financial funds' prospectuses and 
statements of additional information (SAIs). </P>
<P align=left>To the extent that underlying Financial fund assets are traded in 
other markets on days when a fund is not open for business, the value of the 
fund's assets may be affected on those days. In addition, trading in some 
underlying Financial fund assets may not occur on days when a fund is open for 
business. </P>

</div>


<H2 align=left><A name=ref328385></A>Additional Information about the Purchase 
and Sale of Shares</H2>
<P align=left>As used in this prospectus, the term "shares" generally refers to 
the shares offered through this prospectus. </P>
<H3 align=left>General Information</H3>
<P align=left>Certain methods of contacting Financial may be unavailable or 
delayed (for example, during periods of unusual market activity). In addition, 
the level and type of service available may be restricted. </P>
<H3 align=left>Frequent Purchases and Redemptions</H3>
<P align=left>A fund may reject for any reason, or cancel as permitted or 
required by law, any purchase or exchange, including transactions deemed to 
represent excessive trading, at any time. </P>
<P align=left>Excessive trading of fund shares can harm shareholders in various 
ways, including reducing the returns to long-term shareholders by increasing 
costs to a fund (such as brokerage commissions or spreads paid to dealers who 
sell money market instruments), disrupting portfolio management strategies, and 
diluting the value of the shares in cases in which fluctuations in markets are 
not fully priced into the fund's NAV. </P>
<P align=left>Each fund reserves the right at any time to restrict purchases or 
exchanges or impose conditions that are more restrictive on excessive trading 
than those stated in this prospectus. </P>
<H3 align=left>Excessive Trading Policy</H3>
<P align=left>The Board of Trustees has adopted policies designed to discourage 
excessive trading of fund shares. Excessive trading activity in a fund is 
measured by the number of roundtrip transactions in a shareholder's account and 
each class of a multiple class fund is treated separately. A roundtrip 
transaction occurs when a shareholder sells fund shares (including exchanges) 
within 30 days of the purchase date. </P>
<P align=left>Shareholders with two or more roundtrip transactions in a single 
fund within a rolling 90-day period will be blocked from making additional 
purchases or exchange purchases of the fund for 85 days. Shareholders with four 
or more roundtrip transactions across all Financial funds within any rolling 
12-month period will be blocked for at least 85 days from additional purchases 
or exchange purchases across all Financial funds. Any roundtrip within 12 months 
of the expiration of a multi-fund block will initiate another multi-fund block. 
Repeat offenders may be subject to long-term or permanent blocks on purchase or 
exchange purchase transactions in any account under the shareholder's control at 
any time. In addition to enforcing these roundtrip limitations, the fund may in 
its discretion restrict, reject, or cancel any purchases or exchanges that, in 
the Adviser's opinion, may be disruptive to the management of the fund or 
otherwise not be in the fund's interests. </P>
<H3 align=left>Exceptions</H3>
<P align=left>The following transactions are exempt from the fund's excessive 
trading policy described above: (i) transactions of $1,000 or less, (ii) 
systematic withdrawal and/or contribution programs, (iii)&nbsp;mandatory 
retirement distributions, and (iv) transactions initiated by a plan sponsor or 
sponsors of certain employee benefit plans or other related accounts. In 
addition, the fund's excessive trading policy does not apply to transactions 
initiated by the trustee or adviser to a donor-advised charitable gift fund, 
qualified fund of fund(s), or other strategy funds. A qualified fund of fund(s) 
is a mutual fund, qualified tuition program, or other strategy fund consisting 
of qualified plan assets that either applies the fund's excessive trading 
policies to shareholders at the fund of fund(s) level, or demonstrates that the 
fund of fund(s) has an investment strategy coupled with policies designed to 
control frequent trading that are reasonably likely to be effective as 
determined by the fund's Treasurer. </P>
<H3 align=left>Omnibus Accounts</H3>
<P align=left>Omnibus accounts, in which shares are held in the name of an 
intermediary on behalf of multiple investors, are a common form of holding 
shares among retirement plans and financial intermediaries such as brokers, 
advisers, and third-party administrators. Individual trades in omnibus accounts 
are often not disclosed to the fund, making it difficult to determine whether a 
particular shareholder is engaging in excessive trading. Excessive trading in 
omnibus accounts is likely to go undetected by the fund and may increase costs 
to the fund and disrupt its portfolio management. </P>
<P align=left>Under policies adopted by the Board of Trustees, intermediaries 
will be permitted to apply the fund's excessive trading policy (described 
above), or their own excessive trading policy if approved by the Adviser. In 
these cases, the fund will typically not request or receive individual account 
data but will rely on the intermediary to monitor trading activity in good faith 
in accordance with its or the fund's policies. Reliance on intermediaries 
increases the risk that excessive trading may go undetected. For other 
intermediaries, the fund will generally monitor trading activity at the omnibus 
account level to attempt to identify disruptive trades. The fund may request 
transaction information, as frequently as daily, from any intermediary at any 
time, and may apply the fund's policy to transactions that exceed thresholds 
established by the Board of Trustees. The fund may prohibit purchases of fund 
shares by an intermediary or by some or all of any intermediary's clients. There 
is no assurance that the Adviser will request data with sufficient frequency to 
detect or deter excessive trading in omnibus accounts effectively. </P>
<P align=left>If you purchase or sell fund shares through a financial 
intermediary, you may wish to contact the intermediary to determine the policies 
applicable to your account. </P>
<H3 align=left>Retirement Plans</H3>
<P align=left>For employer-sponsored retirement plans, only participant directed 
exchanges count toward the roundtrip limits. Employer-sponsored retirement plan 
participants whose activity triggers a purchase or exchange block will be 
permitted one trade every calendar quarter. In the event of a block, employer 
and participant contributions and loan repayments by the participant may still 
be invested in the fund. </P>
<P align=right><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=justify><B>Shareholder Information - continued</B> </P>
<H3 align=left>Qualified Wrap Programs</H3>
<P align=left>The fund will monitor aggregate trading activity of adviser 
transactions to attempt to identify excessive trading in qualified wrap 
programs, as defined below. Excessive trading by an adviser will lead to fund 
blocks and the wrap program will lose its qualified status. Transactions of an 
adviser will not be matched with client-directed transactions unless the wrap 
program ceases to be a qualified wrap program (but all client-directed 
transactions will be subject to the fund's excessive trading policy). </P>
<P align=left>A qualified wrap program is: (i) a program whose adviser certifies 
that it has investment discretion over $100 million or more in client assets 
invested in mutual funds at the time of the certification, (ii) a program in 
which the adviser directs transactions in the accounts participating in the 
program in concert with changes in a model portfolio, and (iii) managed by an 
adviser who agrees to give the Adviser sufficient information to permit the 
Adviser to identify the individual accounts in the wrap program. </P>
<H3 align=left>Other Information about the Excessive Trading Policy</H3>
<P align=left>The fund's Treasurer is authorized to suspend the fund's policies 
during periods of severe market turbulence or national emergency. The fund 
reserves the right to modify its policies at any time without prior notice. </P>
<P align=left>The fund does not knowingly accommodate frequent purchases and 
redemptions of fund shares by investors, except to the extent permitted by the 
policies described above. </P>
<P align=left>As described in "Valuing Shares," the fund also uses fair value 
pricing to help reduce arbitrage opportunities available to short-term traders. 
There is no assurance that the fund's excessive trading policy will be 
effective, or will successfully detect or deter excessive or disruptive trading. 
</P>
<H3 align=left><A name=ref328393></A>Buying Shares</H3>
<P align=left>The<B> </B>price to buy<B> </B>one share is its NAV. Shares are 
sold without a sales charge. </P>
<P align=left>Shares will be bought at the NAV next calculated after an order is 
received in proper form. </P>
<P align=left>There is no minimum balance or purchase minimum for fund shares. 
</P>
<P align=left>Shares generally are available only to employer-sponsored 
retirement plans (including profit sharing, 401(k), 403(b), 457(b), and similar 
plans) that are recordkept by Financial and meet certain minimum asset levels or, 
if not recordkept by Financial, that already hold shares of Financial 
Freedom<SUP>®</SUP> Funds (funds not offered through this prospectus) and have a 
qualifying investment of i) $5 million in a Financial Freedom<SUP>®</SUP> Fund, 
or ii) plan assets that meet certain minimum asset levels set by Financial. 
Shares may also be available to an employer-sponsored retirement plan whose 
sponsor is involved in a corporate action with a company that sponsors a plan 
for which Financial provides recordkeeping services, in anticipation of a 
transition to the Financial recordkeeping platform. Please contact Financial for 
more information about fund shares. </P>
<P align=left>Shares generally are not available to retail retirement or 
non-retirement accounts, traditional and Roth Individual Retirement Accounts 
(IRAs), Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, SEPs, SARSEPs, SIMPLE IRAs, 
individual 403(b) accounts that are not part of an employer's 403(b) plan, or 
qualified tuition programs. </P>
<P align=left>Shares are generally available only to investors residing in the 
United States. </P>
<P align=left>Each fund may stop offering shares completely or may offer shares 
only on a limited basis, for a period of time or permanently. </P>
<P align=left>Under applicable anti-money laundering rules and other 
regulations, purchase orders may be suspended, restricted, or canceled and the 
monies may be withheld. </P>
<H3 align=left><A name=ref328531></A>Selling Shares</H3>
<P align=left>The price to sell one share is its NAV. </P>
<P align=left>Shares will be sold at the NAV next calculated after an order is 
received in proper form. Normally, redemptions will be processed by the next 
business day, but it may take up to seven days to pay the redemption proceeds if 
making immediate payment would adversely affect a fund. </P>
<P align=left>A signature guarantee is designed to protect you and Financial from 
fraud. Financial may require that your request be made in writing and include a 
signature guarantee in certain circumstances, such as: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>When you wish to sell more than $100,000 worth of shares. 
  <LI>When the address on your account (record address) has changed within the 
  last 15 days or you are requesting that a check be mailed to an address 
  different than the record address. 
  <LI>When you are requesting that redemption proceeds be paid to someone other 
  than the account owner. 
  <LI>In certain situations when the redemption proceeds are being transferred 
  to a Financial account with a different registration. </LI></UL>
<P align=left>You should be able to obtain a signature guarantee from a bank, 
broker (including Financial Investor Centers), dealer, credit union (if 
authorized under state law), securities exchange or association, clearing 
agency, or savings association. A notary public cannot provide a signature 
guarantee. </P>
<P align=left>When you place an order to sell shares, note the following: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Redemption proceeds (other than exchanges) may be delayed until money from 
  prior purchases sufficient to cover your redemption has been received and 
  collected. 
  <LI>Redemptions may be suspended or payment dates postponed when the NYSE is 
  closed (other than weekends or holidays), when trading on the NYSE is 
  restricted, or as permitted by the SEC. 
  <LI>Redemption proceeds may be paid in securities or other property rather 
  than in cash if the Adviser determines it is in the best interests of a fund. 
  </LI></UL>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<UL>
  <LI>You will not receive interest on amounts represented by uncashed

<P align=left>An exchange involves the redemption of all or a portion of the 
shares of one fund and the purchase of shares of another fund. </P>
<P align=left>Shares may be exchanged into shares of any class of a Financial 
fund available through your plan. </P>
<P align=left>However, you should note the following policies and restrictions 
governing exchanges: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>The exchange limit may be modified for accounts held by certain 
  institutional retirement plans to conform to plan exchange limits and 
  Department of Labor regulations. See your retirement plan materials for 
  further information. 
  <LI>Each fund may refuse any exchange purchase for any reason. For example, 
  each fund may refuse exchange purchases by any person or group if, in the 
  Adviser's judgment, the fund would be unable to invest the money effectively 
  in accordance with its investment objective and policies, or would otherwise 
  potentially be adversely affected. 
  <LI>Before any exchange, read the prospectus for the shares you are 
  purchasing, including any purchase and sale requirements. 
  <LI>The shares you are acquiring by exchange must be available for sale in 
  your state. 
  <LI>If you are exchanging between accounts that are not registered in the same

the monies withheld, pending verification of this information or as otherwise 
required under these and other federal regulations. In addition, each fund 
reserves the right to involuntarily redeem an account in the case of: (i) actual 
or suspected threatening conduct or actual or suspected fraudulent, illegal or 
suspicious activity by the account owner or any other individual associated with 
the account; or (ii) the failure of the account owner to provide information to 
the funds related to opening the accounts. Your shares will be sold at the NAV 
minus, if applicable, any short-term redemption fee, calculated on the day 
Financial closes your fund position. </P>

<P align=left>Each fund is a mutual fund, an investment that pools shareholders' 
money and invests it toward a specified goal. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser is each fund's manager. The address of the Adviser and

<P align=left>FDC distributes each fund's shares. </P>
<P align=left>Intermediaries may receive from the Adviser, FDC, and/or their 
affiliates compensation for providing recordkeeping and administrative services, 
as well as other retirement plan expenses, and compensation for services 
intended to result in the sale of fund shares. These payments are described in 
more detail in this section and in the SAI. </P>
<P align=left>Each fund has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to 
Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act that recognizes that the Adviser or FMR may use 
its past profits or its resources from any other source to pay FDC for expenses 
incurred in connection with providing services intended to result in the sale of 
fund shares and/or shareholder support services. The Adviser or FMR, directly or 
through FDC, may pay significant amounts to intermediaries that provide those 
services. Currently, the Board of Trustees of each fund has authorized such 
payments. </P>
<P align=left>If payments made by the Adviser or FMR to FDC or to intermediaries 
under a Distribution and Service Plan were considered to be paid out of a fund's 
assets on an ongoing basis, they might increase the cost of your investment and 
might cost you more than paying other types of sales charges. </P>
<P align=left>From time to time, FDC may offer special promotional programs to 
investors who purchase shares of Financial funds. For example, FDC may offer 
merchandise, discounts, vouchers, or similar items to investors who purchase 
shares of certain Financial funds during certain periods. To determine if you 
qualify for any such programs, contact Financial or visit our web site at 
www.Financial.com. </P>
<P align=left>No dealer, sales representative, or any other person has been 
authorized to give any information or to make any representations, other than 
those contained in this prospectus and in the related SAI, in connection with 
the offer contained in this prospectus. If given or made, such other information 
or representations must not be relied upon as having been authorized by the 
funds or FDC. This prospectus and the related SAI do not constitute an offer by 
the funds or by FDC to sell shares of the funds to or to buy shares of the funds 
from any person to whom it is unlawful to make such offer. </P>

<P align=left>Financial Highlights are intended to help you understand the 
financial history of fund shares for the past 5 years (or, if shorter, the 
period of operations). Certain information reflects financial results for a 
single share. The total returns in the table represent the rate that an investor 
would have earned (or lost) on an investment in shares (assuming reinvestment of 
all dividends and distributions). The annual information has been audited by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, whose 
report, along with fund financial statements, is included in the annual report. 
Annual reports are available for free upon request. </P>
