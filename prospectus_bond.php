<H3 align=left>Portfolio Turnover</H3>
<P align=left>The fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, 
when it buys and sells securities (or "turns over" its portfolio). A higher 
portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in 
higher taxes when fund shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which 
are not reflected in annual operating expenses or in the example, affect the 
fund's performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the fund's portfolio 
turnover rate was 140% of the average value of its portfolio. </P>

<p>2. Investment Strategies and Risks Sections: Please add a comment or comments to help other readers of this section know what information is important.

</div>

<H2 align=left><A name=ref236039></A>Principal Investment Strategies</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Normally investing at least 80% of assets in debt securities of all types 
  and repurchase agreements for those securities. 
  <LI>Using the Barclays<SUP>Â®</SUP> U.S. Universal Bond Index as a guide in 
  allocating assets across the investment-grade, high yield, and emerging market 
  asset classes. 
  <LI>Investing up to 20% of assets in lower-quality debt securities 
  (those of less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield 
  debt securities or junk bonds). 
  <LI>Managing the fund to have similar overall interest rate risk to the index. 

  <LI>Investing in domestic and foreign issuers. 
  <LI>Allocating assets across different asset classes, market sectors, and 
  maturities. 
  <LI>Analyzing the credit quality of the issuer, the issuer's potential for 
  success, the credit, currency, and economic risks of the security and its 
  issuer, security-specific features, current and potential future valuation, 
  and trading opportunities to select investments. 
  <LI>Engaging in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the fund, 
  including investments in derivatives - such as swaps (interest rate, total 
  return, and credit default), options, and futures contracts - and 
  forward-settling securities, to adjust the fund's risk exposure. 
  <LI>Investing in Financial's central funds (specialized investment vehicles 
  used by Financial funds to invest in particular security types or investment 
  disciplines). </LI></UL>
<H2 align=left><A name=ref236033></A>Principal Investment Risks</H2>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Interest Rate Changes.</I> Interest rate increases can cause the price 
  of a debt security to decrease. 
  <LI><I>Foreign Exposure.</I> Foreign markets, particularly emerging markets, 
  can be more volatile than the U.S. market due to increased risks of adverse 
  issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments and can 
  perform differently from the U.S. market. Foreign exchange rates also can be 
  extremely volatile. 
  <LI><I>Prepayment.</I> The ability of an issuer of a debt security to repay 
  principal prior to a security's maturity can cause greater price volatility if 
  interest rates change. 
  <LI><I>Issuer-Specific Changes.</I> The value of an individual security or 
  particular type of security can be more volatile than, and can perform 
  differently from, the market as a whole. A decline in the&nbsp;credit quality 
  of an issuer or a provider of credit support or a maturity-shortening 
  structure for a security can&nbsp;cause the price of a security to decrease. 
  Lower-quality debt securities (those of less than investment-grade quality, 
  also referred to as high yield debt securities or junk bonds) and certain 
  types of other securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due 
  to changes in the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality 
  debt securities and certain types of other securities can be more volatile due 
  to&nbsp;increased sensitivity to adverse issuer,&nbsp;political, regulatory, 
  market, or economic developments and can be difficult to resell. </LI></UL>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<UL>
  <LI><I>Leverage Risk.</I> Leverage can increase market exposure, magnify 
  investment risks, and cause losses to be realized more quickly. </LI></UL>
<P align=left>An investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not 
insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other 
government agency. Unlike individual debt securities, which typically pay 
principal at maturity, the value of an investment in the fund will fluctuate. 
You could lose money by investing in the fund. </P>

<P align=left>The following information is intended to&nbsp;help you understand 
the risks of investing in the fund. The information illustrates the changes in 
the performance of the fund's shares from year to year and compares the 
performance of the fund's shares to the performance of a securities market index 
and an additional index over various periods of time. The indexes have 
characteristics relevant to the fund's investment strategies. Index descriptions 
appear in the Additional Index Information section of the prospectus. Past 
performance (before and after taxes) is not an indication of future performance.

<P align=left><B><I>Principal Investment Strategies</I></B> </P>

<P align=left>The Adviser normally invests at least 80% of the fund's assets in 
debt securities of all types and repurchase agreements for those securities. The 
Adviser allocates the fund's assets across investment-grade, high yield, and 
emerging market debt securities. The Adviser may invest up to 20% of the fund's 
assets in lower-quality debt securities. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser uses the Barclays U.S. Universal Bond Index as a guide 
in structuring the fund and selecting its investments. The Adviser uses the 
index as a guide in allocating the fund's assets across the investment-grade, 
high yield, and emerging market asset classes. The Adviser manages the fund to 
have similar overall interest rate risk to the index. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser considers other factors when selecting the fund's 
investments, including the credit quality of the issuer, security-specific 
features, current valuation relative to alternatives in the market, short-term 
trading opportunities resulting from market inefficiencies, and potential future 
valuation. In managing the fund's exposure to various risks, including interest 
rate risk, the Adviser considers, among other things, the market's overall risk 
characteristics, the market's current pricing of those risks, information on the 
fund's competitive universe and internal views of potential future market 
conditions. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser may invest the fund's assets in securities of foreign 
issuers in addition to securities of domestic issuers. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser may engage in transactions&nbsp;that have a leveraging 
effect on the fund, including investments in derivatives, regardless of whether 
the fund may own the asset, instrument, currency, or components of the index 
underlying the derivative, and forward-settling securities. The Adviser may 
invest a significant portion of the fund's assets in these types of investments. 
If the fund invests a significant portion of its assets in derivatives, its 
investment exposure could far exceed the value of its portfolio securities and 
its investment performance could be primarily dependent upon securities it does 
not own. The fund's derivative investments may include interest rate swaps, 
total return swaps, credit default swaps, options (including options on futures 
and swaps), forwards, and futures contracts (both long and short positions) on 
securities, other instruments, indexes, or currencies. Depending on the 
Adviser's outlook and market conditions, the Adviser may engage in these 
transactions to increase or decrease the fund's exposure to changing security 
prices, interest rates, credit qualities, foreign exchange rates, or other 
factors that affect security values, or to gain or reduce exposure to an asset, 
instrument, currency, or index. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser allocates the fund's assets among different asset 
classes using the composition of the index as a guide, and among different 
market sectors (for example, corporate, asset-backed, or government securities) 
and different maturities based on its view of the relative value of each sector 
or maturity. </P>
<P align=right><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><B>Fund Basics - continued</B> </P>
<P align=left>In selecting foreign securities, the Adviser's analysis also 
considers the credit, currency, and economic risks associated with the security 
and the country of its issuer. The Adviser may also consider an issuer's 
potential for success in light of its current financial condition, its industry 
position, and economic and market conditions. </P>
<P align=left>To earn additional income for the fund, the Adviser may use a 
trading strategy that involves selling (or buying) mortgage securities and 
simultaneously agreeing to purchase (or sell) mortgage securities on a later 
date at a set price. This trading strategy may increase interest rate exposure 
and result in an increased portfolio turnover rate which increases transaction 
costs and may increase taxable gains. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser uses central funds to help invest the fund's assets. 
Central funds are specialized investment vehicles designed to be used by 
Financial funds. Financial uses them to invest in particular security types or 
investment disciplines; for example, rather than buy bonds directly, the fund 
may invest in a central fund that buys bonds. Financial does not charge any 
additional management fees for central funds. Central funds offer exposure to 
some or all of the following types of investment-grade and lower-quality debt 
securities: corporate bonds, mortgage and other asset-backed securities, 
floating rate loans, and BB-rated securities. Central funds may also focus on 
other types of securities. </P>
<P align=left>If the Adviser's strategies do not work as intended, the fund may 
not achieve its objective. </P>
<P align=left><B><I>Description of Principal Security Types</I></B> </P>
<P align=left><I>Debt securities</I> are used by issuers to borrow money. The 
issuer usually pays a fixed, variable, or floating rate of interest, and must 
repay the amount borrowed, usually at the maturity of the security. Some debt 
securities, such as zero coupon bonds, do not pay current interest but are sold 
at a discount from their face values. Debt securities include corporate bonds, 
government securities, repurchase agreements, money market securities, mortgage 
and other asset-backed securities, loans and loan participations, and other 
securities believed to have debt-like characteristics, including hybrids and 
synthetic securities. </P>
<P align=left>A <I>repurchase agreement</I> is an agreement to buy a security at 
one price and a simultaneous agreement to sell it back at an agreed-upon price. 
</P>
<P align=left><I>Derivatives</I> are investments whose values are tied to an 
underlying asset, instrument, currency, or index. Derivatives include futures, 
options, forwards, and swaps, such as interest rate swaps (exchanging a floating 
rate for a fixed rate), total return swaps (exchanging a floating rate for the 
total return of an index, security, or other instrument or investment) and 
credit default swaps (buying or selling credit default protection). 
Currency-related derivatives, in particular, include foreign exchange (FX) 
transactions such as spot FX trades, FX forwards, non-deliverable forwards, and 
cross-currency FX trades. </P>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><I>Forward-settling securities</I> involve a commitment to 
purchase or sell specific securities when issued, or at a predetermined price or 
yield. When a fund does not already own or have the right to obtain securities 
equivalent in kind and amount, a commitment to sell securities is equivalent to 
a short sale. Payment and delivery take place after the customary settlement 
period. </P>
<P align=left><I>Central funds</I> are special types of investment vehicles 
created by Financial for use by Financial funds and other advisory clients. 
Central funds incur certain costs related to their investment activity (such as 
custodial fees and expenses), but do not pay additional management fees. The 
investment results of the portions of the fund's assets invested in the central 
funds will be based upon the investment results of those funds. </P>

<P align=left>Many factors affect the fund's performance. The fund's share price 
and yield change daily based on changes in market conditions and interest rates 
and in response to other economic, political, or financial developments. The 
fund's reaction to these developments will be affected by the types and 
maturities of securities in which the fund invests, the financial condition, 
industry and economic sector, and geographic location of an issuer, and the 
fund's level of investment in the securities of that issuer. Unlike individual 
debt securities, which typically pay principal at maturity, the value of an 
investment in the fund will fluctuate. When you sell your shares they may be 
worth more or less than what you paid for them, which means that you could lose 
money by investing in the fund. </P>
<P align=left>The following factors can significantly affect the fund's 
performance: </P>
<P align=left><I>Interest Rate Changes.</I> Debt securities, including money 
market securities, have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in interest 
rates. In general, the price of a debt security can fall when interest rates 
rise and can rise when interest rates fall. Securities with longer maturities 
and certain types of securities, such as mortgage securities and the securities 
of issuers in the financial services sector, can be more sensitive to interest 
rate changes, meaning the longer the maturity of a security, the greater the 
impact a change in interest rates could have on the security's price. Short-term 
and long-term interest rates do not necessarily move in the same amount or the 
same direction. Short-term securities tend to react to changes in short-term 
interest rates, and long-term securities tend to react to changes in long-term 
interest rates. Securities with floating interest rates can be less sensitive to 
interest rate changes, but may decline in value if their interest rates do not 
rise as&nbsp;much as interest rates in general. Securities whose payment at 
maturity is based on the movement of all or part of an index and 
inflation-protected debt securities may react differently from other types of 
debt securities. </P>
<P align=left><I>Foreign Exposure.</I> Foreign securities, foreign currencies, 
and securities issued by U.S. entities with substantial foreign operations can 
involve additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory 
conditions in foreign countries. These risks include fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates; withholding or other taxes; trading, settlement, custodial, and 
other operational risks; and the less stringent investor protection and 
disclosure standards of some foreign markets. All of these factors can make 
foreign investments, especially those in emerging markets, more volatile and 
potentially less liquid than U.S. investments. In addition, foreign markets can 
perform differently from the U.S. market. </P>
<P align=right><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><B>Fund Basics - continued</B> </P>
<P align=left>Investing in emerging markets can involve risks in addition to and 
greater than those generally associated with investing in more developed foreign 
markets. The extent of economic development; political stability; market depth, 
infrastructure, and capitalization; and regulatory oversight can be less than in 
more developed markets. Emerging market economies can be subject to greater 
social, economic, regulatory, and political uncertainties. All of these factors 
can make emerging market securities more volatile and potentially less liquid 
than securities issued in more developed markets. </P>
<P align=left>Global economies and financial markets are becoming increasingly 
interconnected, which increases the possibilities that conditions in one country 
or region might adversely impact issuers or providers in, or foreign exchange 
rates with, a different country or region. </P>
<P align=left><I>Prepayment.</I> Many types of debt securities, including 
mortgage securities, are subject to prepayment risk. Prepayment risk occurs when 
the issuer of a security can repay principal prior to the security's maturity. 
Securities subject to prepayment can offer less potential for gains during a 
declining interest rate environment and similar or greater potential for loss in 
a rising interest rate environment. In addition, the potential impact of 
prepayment features on the price of a debt security can be difficult to predict 
and result in greater volatility. </P>
<P align=left><I>Issuer-Specific Changes.</I> Changes in the financial condition 
of an issuer or counterparty, changes in specific economic or political 
conditions that affect a particular type of security or issuer, and changes in 
general economic or political conditions can increase the risk of default by an 
issuer or counterparty, which can affect a security's or instrument's credit 
quality or value. The value of securities of smaller, less well-known issuers 
can be more volatile than that of larger issuers. Entities providing credit 
support or a maturity-shortening structure also can be affected by these types 
of changes, and if the structure of a security fails to function as intended, 
the security could decline in value. Lower-quality debt securities (those of 
less than investment-grade quality, also referred to as high yield debt 
securities or junk bonds) and certain types of other securities tend to be 
particularly sensitive to these changes. </P>
<P align=left>Lower-quality debt securities and certain types of other 
securities involve greater risk of default or price changes due to changes in 
the credit quality of the issuer. The value of lower-quality debt securities and 
certain types of other securities often fluctuates in response to company, 
political, or economic developments and can decline significantly over short as 
well as long periods of time or during periods of general or regional economic 
difficulty. Lower-quality debt securities can be thinly traded or have 
restrictions on resale, making them difficult to sell at an acceptable price, 
and often are considered to be speculative. The default rate for lower-quality 
debt securities is likely to be higher during economic recessions or periods of 
high interest rates. </P>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><I>Leverage Risk.</I> Derivatives, forward-settling securities, 
and short sale transactions involve leverage because they can provide investment 
exposure in an amount exceeding the initial investment. Leverage can magnify 
investment risks and cause losses to be realized more quickly. A small change in 
the underlying asset, instrument, or index can lead to a significant loss. 
Assets segregated to cover these transactions may decline in value and are not 
available to meet redemptions. Forward-settling securities and short sale 
transactions also involve the risk that a security will not be issued, 
delivered, available for purchase, or paid for when anticipated. An increase in 
the market price of securities sold short will result in a loss. Government 
legislation or regulation could affect the use of these transactions and could 
limit a fund's ability to pursue its investment strategies. </P>
<P align=left>In response to market, economic, political, or other conditions, a 
fund may temporarily use a different investment strategy for defensive purposes. 
If the fund does so, different factors could affect its performance and the fund 
may not achieve its investment objective. </P>

<P align=left>NAV is the value of a single share. Financial normally calculates 
NAV as of the close of business of the NYSE, normally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time. 
The fund's assets normally are valued as of this time for the purpose of

<P align=left>NAV is not calculated and the fund will not process purchase and

<P align=left>To the extent that the fund's assets are traded in other markets 
on days when the fund is not open for business, the value of the fund's assets

<P align=left>NAV is calculated using the values of the underlying central funds

quotations, official closing prices, or information furnished by a pricing 
service. Certain short-term securities are valued on the basis of amortized 
cost. If market quotations, official closing prices, or information furnished by 
a pricing service are not readily available or, in the Adviser's opinion, are 
deemed unreliable for a security, then that security will be fair valued in good 
faith by the Adviser in accordance with applicable fair value pricing policies. 
For example, if, in the Adviser's opinion, a security's value has been 
materially affected by events occurring before a fund's pricing time but after 
the close of the exchange or market on which the security is principally traded, 
then that security will be fair valued in good faith by the Adviser in 
accordance with applicable fair value pricing policies. Fair value pricing will 
be used for high yield debt securities when available pricing information is 
determined to be stale or for other reasons not to accurately reflect fair 
value. Assets held by an underlying money market central fund are valued on the 
basis of amortized cost. </P>
<P align=left>Arbitrage opportunities may exist when trading in a portfolio 
security or securities is halted and does not resume before a fund calculates 
its NAV. These arbitrage opportunities may enable short-term traders to dilute 
the NAV of long-term investors. Securities trading in overseas markets present 
time zone arbitrage opportunities when events affecting portfolio security 
values occur after the close of the overseas markets but prior to the close of 
the U.S. market. Fair valuation of a fund's portfolio securities can serve to 
reduce arbitrage opportunities available to short-term traders, but there is no 
assurance that fair value pricing policies will prevent dilution of NAV by 
short-term traders. </P>
<P align=left>Policies regarding excessive trading may not be effective to 
prevent short-term NAV arbitrage trading, particularly in regard to omnibus 
accounts. </P>
<P align=left>Fair value pricing is based on subjective judgments and it is 
possible that the fair value of a security may differ materially from the value 
that would be realized if the security were sold. </P>

name=tbd251583>Additional Information about the Purchase and Sale of 
Shares</A></H2>
<P align=left>As used in this prospectus, the term "shares" generally refers to 
the shares offered through this prospectus. </P>
<H3 align=left>General Information</H3>
<P align=left>Financial Investments was established in 1946 to manage one of 
America's first mutual funds. Today, Financial is one of the world's largest 
providers of financial services. </P>
<P align=left>In addition to its mutual fund business, the company operates one 
of America's leading brokerage firms, Financial Brokerage Services LLC. Financial 
is also a leader in providing tax-advantaged retirement plans for individuals 
investing on their own or through their employer. </P>
<P align=left>Subject to the purchase and sale requirements stated in this 
prospectus, you may buy or sell shares through a Financial brokerage account or a 
Financial mutual fund account. If you buy or sell shares (other than by exchange) 
through a Financial brokerage account, your transactions generally involve your 
Financial brokerage core (a settlement vehicle included as part of your Financial 
brokerage account). </P>
<P align=left>If you do not currently have a Financial brokerage account or a 
Financial mutual fund account and would like to invest in a fund, you may need to 
complete an application. For more information about a Financial brokerage account 
or a Financial mutual fund account, please visit Financial's web site at 
www.financial.com, call 1-800-FIDELITY, or visit a Financial Investor Center (call 
1-800-544-9797 for the center nearest you). </P>
<P align=left>You may also buy or sell shares through a retirement account (such 
as an IRA or an account funded through salary deduction) or an investment 
professional. Retirement specialists are available at 1-800-544-4774 to answer 
your questions about Financial retirement products. If you buy or sell shares 
through a retirement account or an investment professional, the procedures for 
buying, selling, and exchanging shares and the account features, policies, and 
fees may differ from those discussed in this prospectus. Fees in addition to 
those discussed in this prospectus may apply. For example, you may be charged a 
transaction fee if you buy or sell shares through a non-Financial broker or other 
investment professional. </P>
<P align=left><B>You should include the following information with any 
order:</B> </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Your name 
  <LI>Your account number 
  <LI>Type of transaction requested 
  <LI>Name(s) of fund(s) and class(es) 
  <LI>Dollar amount or number of shares </LI></UL>
<P align=left>Certain methods of contacting Financial may be unavailable or 
delayed (for example, during periods of unusual market activity). In addition, 
the level and type of service available may be restricted. </P>
<H3 align=left>Frequent Purchases and Redemptions</H3>
<P align=left>The fund may reject for any reason, or cancel as permitted or 
required by law, any purchase or exchange, including transactions deemed to 
represent excessive trading, at any time. </P>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left>Excessive trading of fund shares can harm shareholders in various 
ways, including reducing the returns to long-term shareholders by increasing 
costs to the fund (such as brokerage commissions or spreads paid to dealers who 
sell money market instruments), disrupting portfolio management strategies, and 
diluting the value of the shares in cases in which fluctuations in markets are 
not fully priced into the fund's NAV. </P>
<P align=left>The fund reserves the right at any time to restrict purchases or 
exchanges or impose conditions that are more restrictive on excessive trading 
than those stated in this prospectus. </P>
<H3 align=left>Excessive Trading Policy</H3>
<P align=left>The Board of Trustees has adopted policies designed to discourage 
excessive trading of fund shares. Excessive trading activity in a fund is 
measured by the number of roundtrip transactions in a shareholder's account and 
each class of a multiple class fund is treated separately. A roundtrip 
transaction occurs when a shareholder sells fund shares (including exchanges) 
within 30 days of the purchase date. </P>
<P align=left>Shareholders with two or more roundtrip transactions in a single 
fund within a rolling 90-day period will be blocked from making additional 
purchases or exchange purchases of the fund for 85 days. Shareholders with four 
or more roundtrip transactions across all Financial funds within any rolling 
12-month period will be blocked for at least 85 days from additional purchases 
or exchange purchases across all Financial funds. Any roundtrip within 12 months 
of the expiration of a multi-fund block will initiate another multi-fund block. 
Repeat offenders may be subject to long-term or permanent blocks on purchase or 
exchange purchase transactions in any account under the shareholder's control at 
any time. In addition to enforcing these roundtrip limitations, the fund may in 
its discretion restrict, reject, or cancel any purchases or exchanges that, in 
the Adviser's opinion, may be disruptive to the management of the fund or 
otherwise not be in the fund's interests. </P>
<H3 id=ATB_TBD_Pros_main.html.73 align=left>Exceptions</H3>
<P align=left>The following transactions are exempt from the fund's excessive 
trading policy described above: (i) transactions of $1,000 or less, (ii) 
systematic withdrawal and/or contribution programs, (iii)&nbsp;mandatory 
retirement distributions, and (iv) transactions initiated by&nbsp;a plan sponsor 
or sponsors of certain employee benefit plans or other related accounts. In 
addition, the fund's excessive trading policy does not apply to transactions 
initiated by the trustee or adviser to a donor-advised charitable gift fund, 
qualified fund of fund(s), or other strategy funds. A qualified fund of fund(s) 
is a mutual fund, qualified tuition program, or other strategy fund consisting 
of qualified plan assets that either applies the fund's excessive trading 
policies to shareholders at the fund of fund(s) level, or demonstrates that the 
fund of fund(s) has an investment strategy coupled with policies designed to 
control frequent trading that are reasonably likely to be effective as 
determined by the fund's Treasurer. </P>
<P align=right><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left><B>Shareholder Information - continued</B> </P>
<H3 align=left>Omnibus Accounts</H3>
<P align=left>Omnibus accounts, in which shares are&nbsp;held in the name of an 
intermediary on behalf of multiple investors, are a common form of holding 
shares among retirement plans and financial intermediaries such as brokers, 
advisers, and third-party administrators. Individual trades in omnibus accounts 
are often not disclosed to the fund, making it difficult to determine whether a 
particular shareholder is engaging in excessive trading. Excessive trading in 
omnibus accounts is likely to go undetected by the fund and may increase costs 
to the fund and disrupt its portfolio management. </P>
<P align=left>Under policies adopted by the Board of&nbsp;Trustees, 
intermediaries will be permitted to apply the fund's excessive trading policy 
(described above), or their own excessive trading policy if approved by the 
Adviser. In these cases, the fund will typically not request or receive 
individual account data but will rely on the intermediary to monitor trading 
activity in good faith in accordance with its or the fund's policies. Reliance 
on intermediaries increases the risk that excessive trading may go undetected. 
For other intermediaries, the fund will generally monitor trading activity at 
the omnibus account level to attempt to identify disruptive trades. The fund may 
request transaction information, as frequently as daily, from any intermediary 
at any time, and may apply the fund's policy to transactions that exceed 
thresholds established by the Board of Trustees. The fund may prohibit purchases 
of fund shares by an intermediary or by some or all of any intermediary's 
clients. There is no assurance that the Adviser will request data with 
sufficient frequency to detect or deter excessive trading in omnibus accounts 
effectively. </P>
<P align=left>If you purchase or sell fund shares through a financial 
intermediary, you may wish to contact the intermediary to determine the policies 
applicable to your account. </P>
<H3 align=left>Retirement Plans</H3>
<P align=left>For employer-sponsored retirement plans, only participant directed 
exchanges count toward the roundtrip limits. Employer-sponsored retirement plan 
participants whose activity triggers a purchase or exchange block will be 
permitted one trade every calendar quarter. In the event of a block, employer 
and participant contributions and loan repayments by the participant may still 
be invested in the fund. </P>
<H3 align=left>Qualified Wrap Programs</H3>
<P align=left>The fund will monitor aggregate trading activity of adviser 
transactions to attempt to identify excessive trading in qualified wrap 
programs, as defined below. Excessive trading by an adviser will lead to fund 
blocks and the wrap program will lose its qualified status. Transactions of an 
adviser will not be matched with client-directed transactions unless the wrap 
program ceases to be a qualified wrap program (but all client-directed 
transactions will be subject to the fund's excessive trading policy). </P>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left>A qualified wrap program is: (i) a program whose adviser certifies 
that it has investment discretion over $100 million or more in client assets 
invested in mutual funds at the time of the certification, (ii) a program in 
which the adviser directs transactions in the accounts participating in the 
program in concert with changes in a model portfolio, and (iii) managed by an 
adviser who agrees to give the Adviser sufficient information to permit the 
Adviser to identify the individual accounts in the wrap program. </P>
<H3 align=left>Other Information about the Excessive Trading Policy</H3>
<P align=left>The fund's Treasurer is authorized to suspend the fund's policies 
during periods of severe market turbulence or national emergency. The fund 
reserves the right to modify its policies at any time without prior notice. </P>
<P align=left>The fund does not knowingly accommodate frequent purchases and 
redemptions of fund shares by investors, except to the extent permitted by the 
policies described above. </P>
<P align=left>As described in "Valuing Shares," the fund also uses fair value 
pricing to help reduce arbitrage opportunities available to short-term traders. 
There is no assurance that the fund's excessive trading policy will be 
effective, or will successfully detect or deter excessive or disruptive trading. 
</P>
<H3 align=left><A name=ref236051></A>Buying Shares</H3>
<P align=left>The<B> </B>price to buy<B> </B>one share is its NAV. Shares are 
sold without a sales charge. </P>
<P align=left>Shares will be bought at the NAV next calculated after your 
investment is received in proper form. </P>
<P align=left>The fund has authorized certain intermediaries to accept orders to 
buy shares on its behalf. When authorized intermediaries receive an order in 
proper form, the order is considered as being placed with the fund, and shares 
will be bought at the NAV next calculated after the order is received by the 
authorized intermediary. Orders by funds of funds for which Financial serves as 
investment manager will be treated as received by the fund at the same time that 
the corresponding orders are received in proper form by the funds of funds. </P>
<P align=left>There is no minimum balance or purchase minimum for investments 
through Portfolio Advisory Services, a mutual fund or a qualified tuition 
program for which Financial serves as investment manager, certain Financial 
retirement accounts funded through salary deduction, or fund positions opened 
with the proceeds of distributions from such retirement accounts or from a 
Financial systematic withdrawal service. In addition, the fund may waive or lower 
purchase minimums in other circumstances. </P>
<P align=left>Shares are generally available only to investors residing 
in the United States. </P>
<P align=left>The fund may stop offering shares completely or may offer shares 
only on a limited basis, for a period of time or permanently. </P>
<P align=left>If your payment is not received and collected, your purchase may 
be canceled and you could be liable for any losses or fees the fund or Financial 
has incurred. </P>
<P align=left>Certain financial institutions that have entered into sales 
agreements with FDC may enter confirmed purchase orders on behalf of customers 
by phone, with payment to follow no later than the time when fund shares are 
priced on the following business day. If payment is not received by that time, 
the order will be canceled and the financial institution could be held liable 
for resulting fees or losses. </P>

<H3 align=left><A name=ref236021></A>Selling Shares</H3>
<P align=left>The price to sell one share is its NAV. </P>
<P align=left>Shares will be sold at the NAV next calculated after an order is 
received in proper form. Normally, redemptions will be processed by the next 
business day, but it may take up to seven days to pay the redemption proceeds if 
making immediate payment would adversely affect the fund. </P>
<P align=left>The fund has authorized certain intermediaries to accept orders to 
sell shares on its behalf. When authorized intermediaries receive an order in 
proper form, the order is considered as being placed with the fund, and shares 
will be sold at the NAV next calculated after the order is received by the 
authorized intermediary. Orders by funds of funds for which Financial serves as 
investment manager will be treated as received by the fund at the same time that 
the corresponding orders are received in proper form by the funds of funds. </P>
<P align=left>A signature guarantee is designed to protect you and Financial from 
fraud. If you hold your shares in a Financial mutual fund account and submit your 
request to Financial by mail, Financial may require that your request be made in 
writing and include a signature guarantee in certain circumstances, such as: 
</P>
<UL>
  <LI>When you wish to sell more than $100,000 worth of shares. 
  <LI>When the address on your account (record address) has changed within the 
  last 15 days or you are requesting that a check be mailed to an address 
  different than the record address. 
  <LI>When you are requesting that redemption proceeds be paid to someone other 
  than the account owner. 
  <LI>In certain situations when the redemption proceeds are being transferred 
  to a Financial mutual fund account with a different registration. </LI></UL>
<P align=left>You should be able to obtain a signature guarantee from a bank, 
broker (including Financial Investor Centers), dealer, credit union (if 
authorized under state law), securities exchange or association, clearing 
agency, or savings association. A notary public cannot provide a signature 
guarantee. </P>
<P align=left>When you place an order to sell shares, note the following: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>If you are selling some but not all of&nbsp;your shares, keep your fund 
  balance above the required minimum to keep your fund position open, except 
  fund positions not subject to balance minimums. 
  <LI>Redemption proceeds (other than exchanges) may be delayed until money from 
  prior purchases sufficient to cover your redemption has been received and 
  collected. </LI></UL>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<UL>
  <LI>Redemptions may be suspended or payment dates postponed when the NYSE is 
  closed (other than weekends or holidays), when trading on the NYSE is 
  restricted, or as permitted by the SEC. 
  <LI>Redemption proceeds may be paid in securities or other property rather 
  than in cash if the Adviser determines it is in the best interests of the 
  fund. 
  <LI>You will not receive interest on amounts represented by uncashed 
  redemption checks. 
  <LI>If you hold your shares in a Financial mutual fund account and your 
  redemption check remains uncashed for six months, the check may be invested in 
  additional shares at the NAV next calculated on the day of the investment. 
  <LI>Under applicable anti-money laundering rules and other 
  regulations, redemption requests may be suspended, restricted, canceled, or 
  processed and the proceeds may be withheld. </LI></UL>

<P align=left>An exchange involves the redemption of all or a portion of the 
shares of one fund and the purchase of shares of another fund. </P>
<P align=left>As a shareholder, you have the privilege of exchanging shares for 
shares of other Financial funds. </P>
<P align=left>However, you should note the following policies and restrictions 
governing exchanges: </P>
<UL>
  <LI>The exchange limit may be modified for accounts held by certain 
  institutional retirement plans to conform to plan exchange limits and 
  Department of Labor regulations. See your retirement plan materials for 
  further information. 
  <LI>The fund may refuse any exchange purchase for any reason. For example, the 
  fund may refuse exchange purchases by any person or group if, in the Adviser's 
  judgment, the fund would be unable to invest the money effectively in 
  accordance with its investment objective and policies, or would otherwise 
  potentially be adversely affected. 
  <LI>Before any exchange, read the prospectus for the shares you are 
  purchasing, including any purchase and sale requirements. 
  <LI>The shares you are acquiring by exchange must be available for sale in 
  your state. 
  <LI>Exchanges may have tax consequences for you. 
  <LI>If you are exchanging between accounts that are not registered in the same 
  name, address, and taxpayer identification number (TIN), there may be 
  additional requirements. 
  <LI>Under applicable anti-money laundering rules and other 
  regulations, exchange requests may be&nbsp;suspended, restricted, canceled, or 
  processed and the proceeds may be withheld. </LI></UL>
<P align=left>The fund may terminate or modify exchange privileges in the

not send multiple copies of these documents to you and members of your family 
who share the same address. Instead, we will send only a single copy of these 
documents. This will continue for as long as you are a shareholder, unless you 
notify us otherwise. If at any time you choose to receive individual copies of 
any documents, please call 1-800-544-8544. We will begin sending individual

expense, or other liability resulting from unauthorized transactions if it 
follows reasonable security procedures designed to verify the identity of the 
investor. Financial will request personalized security codes or other 
information, and may also record calls. For transactions conducted through the 
Internet, Financial recommends the use of an Internet browser with 128-bit 
encryption. You should verify the accuracy of your confirmation statements upon 
receipt and notify Financial immediately of any discrepancies in your account 
activity. If you do not want the ability to sell and exchange by telephone, call 
Financial for instructions. </P>
<P align=left>You may also be asked to provide additional information in order 
for Financial to verify your identity in accordance with requirements under 
anti-money laundering regulations. Accounts may be restricted and/or closed, and 
the monies withheld, pending verification of&nbsp;this information or as 
otherwise required under these and other federal regulations. In addition, the 
fund reserves the right to involuntarily redeem an account in the case of: (i) 
actual or suspected threatening conduct or actual or suspected fraudulent, 
illegal or suspicious activity by the account owner or any other individual 
associated with the account; or (ii) the failure of the account owner to provide

<P align=left>Financial may deduct a<B> small balance maintenance fee</B> of

expected that fund balances will be valued after November 1 but prior to 
December 31 of each calendar year. Fund positions opened after September 30 will 
not be subject to the fee for that calendar year. The fee, which is payable to 
Financial, is designed to offset in part the relatively higher costs of servicing 
smaller fund positions. This fee will not be deducted from fund positions opened 
after January 1 of that calendar year if those positions use certain regular 
investment plans. </P>

<P align=left>When you open an account, specify on your application how you want 
to receive your distributions. The following distribution options are available: 
</P>
<P align=left><B>1. Reinvestment Option.</B> Any dividends and capital gain 
distributions will be automatically reinvested in additional shares. If you do 
not indicate a choice on your application, you will be assigned this option. 
</P>
<P align=left><B>2. Income-Earned Option.</B> Any capital gain distributions 
will be automatically reinvested in additional shares. Any dividends will be 
paid in cash. </P>
<P align=left><B>3. Cash Option.</B> Any dividends and capital gain 
distributions will be paid in&nbsp;cash. </P>
<P align=left><B>4. Directed Dividends</B><SUP>Â®</SUP><B> Option.</B> Any 
dividends will be automatically invested in shares of another identically 
registered Financial fund. Any capital gain distributions will be automatically 
invested in shares of another identically registered Financial fund, 
automatically reinvested in additional shares of the fund, or paid in cash. </P>
<P align=left>Not all distribution options may be available for every account 
and certain restrictions may apply. If the distribution&nbsp;option you prefer 
is not listed on your account application, or if you want to change your current 
distribution option,&nbsp;visit Financial's web site at www.financial.com or call 
1-800-544-6666 for more information. </P>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left>If you elect to receive distributions paid in cash by check and 
the U.S. Postal Service does not deliver your checks, your distribution option 
may be converted to the Reinvestment Option. You will not receive interest on 
amounts represented by uncashed distribution checks. </P>
<P align=left>If your dividend check(s) remains uncashed for six months, your 
check(s) may be invested in additional shares at the NAV next calculated on the 
day of the investment. </P>
<H2 id=0.1.CD42F31.1S77WI.7S4UWN.X4 align=left><A name=ref236003></A><A 
name=tbd251587>Tax Consequences</A></H2>
<P align=left>As with any investment, your investment in the fund could have tax 
consequences for you. If you are not investing through a tax-advantaged 
retirement account, you should consider these tax consequences. </P>
<P align=left><B>Taxes on distributions.</B> Distributions you receive from the 
fund are subject to federal income tax, and may also be subject to state or 
local taxes. </P>
<P align=left>For federal tax purposes, certain of the fund's distributions, 
including dividends and distributions of short-term capital gains, are taxable 
to you as ordinary income, while certain of the fund's distributions, including 
distributions of long-term capital gains, are taxable to you generally as 
capital gains. Because the fund's income is primarily derived from interest, 
dividends from the fund generally will not qualify for the long-term capital 
gains tax rates available to individuals. </P>
<P align=left>If a fund's distributions exceed its income and capital gains 
realized in any year, which is sometimes the result of currency-related losses, 
all or a portion of those distributions may be treated as a return of capital to 
shareholders for tax purposes. A return of capital generally will not be taxable 
to you but will reduce the cost basis of your shares and result in a higher 
reported capital gain or a lower reported capital loss when you sell your 
shares. </P>
<P align=left>If you buy shares when a fund has realized but not yet distributed 
income or capital gains, you will be "buying a dividend" by paying the full 
price for the shares and then receiving a portion of the price back in the form 
of a taxable distribution. </P>
<P align=left>Any taxable distributions you receive from the fund will normally 
be taxable to you when you receive them, regardless of your distribution option. 
If you elect to receive distributions in cash or to invest distributions 
automatically in shares of another Financial fund, you will receive certain 
December distributions in January, but those distributions will be taxable as if 
you received them on December 31. </P>
<P align=left><B>Taxes on transactions.</B> Your redemptions, including 
exchanges, may result in a capital gain or loss for federal tax purposes. A 
capital gain or loss on your investment in the fund generally is the difference 
between the cost of your shares and the price you receive when you sell them.

<P align=left>The fund pays a management fee to the Adviser. The management fee 
is calculated and paid to the Adviser every month. The fee is calculated by 
adding a group fee rate to an individual fund fee rate, dividing by twelve, and 
multiplying the result by the fund's average net assets throughout the month. 
</P>
<P align=left>The group fee rate is based on the average net assets of all the 
mutual funds advised by FMR. For this purpose, the average net assets of any 
mutual funds previously advised by FMR that currently are advised by Financial 
SelectCo, LLC are included. This rate cannot rise above 0.37%, and it drops as 
total assets under management increase. </P>
<P align=left>For August 2015, the group fee rate was 0.11%. The 
individual fund fee rate is&nbsp;0.20%. </P>
<P align=left>The total management fee for the fiscal year ended August 
31, 2015, was 0.31% of the fund's average net assets. Because the fund's 
management fee rate may fluctuate, the fund's management fee may be higher or 
lower in the future. </P>
<P align=left>The Adviser pays FIMM, FMRC, FMR U.K., FMR H.K., and FMR Japan for 
providing sub-advisory services. The Adviser pays FIA for providing sub-advisory 
services, and FIA in turn pays FIA(UK). FIA in turn pays FIJ for providing 
sub-advisory services. </P>
<P align=left>The basis for the Board of Trustees approving the 
management contract and sub-advisory agreements for the fund is available in the 
fund's semi-annual report for the fiscal period ended February 28, 
2015. </P>
<P align=left>From time to time, the Adviser or its affiliates may agree to 
reimburse or waive certain fund expenses while retaining the ability to be 
repaid if expenses fall below the specified limit prior to the end of the fiscal 
year. </P>
<P align=left>Reimbursement or waiver arrangements can decrease expenses and 
boost performance. </P>

<P align=left>The fund is composed of multiple classes of shares. All classes of 
the fund have a common investment objective and investment portfolio. </P>
<P align=left>FDC distributes the fund's shares. </P>
<P align=left>Intermediaries may receive from the Adviser, FDC, and/or their 
affiliates compensation for providing recordkeeping and administrative services, 
as well as other retirement plan expenses, and compensation for services 
intended to result in the sale of fund shares. These payments are described in 
more detail in this section and in the SAI. </P>
<P align=left>The fund has adopted a Distribution and Service Plan pursuant to 
Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (1940 Act) with respect to 
its shares that recognizes that the Adviser may use its management fee revenues, 
as well as its past profits or its resources from any other source, to pay FDC 
for expenses incurred in connection with providing services intended to result 
in the sale of&nbsp;shares of the fund and/or shareholder&nbsp;support services. 
The Adviser, directly or through FDC, may pay significant amounts to 
intermediaries that provide those services. Currently, the Board of Trustees of 
the fund has authorized such payments for shares of the fund. </P>
<P align=left><B><I><FONT size=-2>Prospectus</FONT></I></B> </P>
<P align=left>If payments made by the Adviser to FDC or to intermediaries under 
the Distribution and Service Plan were considered to be paid out of a class's 
assets on an ongoing basis, they might increase the cost of your investment and 
might cost you more than paying other types of sales charges. </P>
<P align=left>From time to time, FDC may offer special promotional programs to 
investors who purchase shares of Financial funds. For example, FDC may offer 
merchandise, discounts, vouchers, or similar items to investors who purchase
